Step-by-Step Audio Guided Tour: Outdoor Sculpture Park

Stop 1: Jim Dine – Two Big Black Hearts

Orientation:
Begin your tour at the main entrance to deCordova’s Sculpture Park. Step onto the paved path leading from the front of the museum building. Directly ahead of you, you’ll see two towering bronze hearts—bold, black, and looming with texture.

Narration:
These massive sculptures, Two Big Black Hearts by Jim Dine, set the tone for your exploration of the Sculpture Park. At first glance, they seem like Valentine’s Day icons gone monumental—but there’s much more than sentimentality here.
Jim Dine, an American artist affiliated loosely with the Pop Art movement, has spent decades exploring everyday symbols—hearts, robes, tools—and imbuing them with deeply personal and psychological resonance. These hearts are not slick or pretty; they’re rough, scarred, and deeply textured. They speak to love, yes, but also to labor, grief, endurance, and the physicality of making.
Standing between them, you might feel dwarfed or embraced—or both. Their scale invites you to consider the monumental weight of emotion and the space it occupies in the public realm. Dine’s hearts, unlike sweet confections or digital icons, have heft and presence.
Culturally, the heart symbol is nearly universal—but here, Dine strips it of cliché and returns it to something primal and sculptural. Societally, these forms suggest that emotion, particularly love, deserves not just expression but permanence. They endure like bronze memorials to feeling itself.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: follow the path downhill and to the right, where you'll find a tall, rusted steel wall curving through the landscape—this is Berlin Wall Section by unknown artists, imported as a historical artifact.

Stop 2 has been omitted due to lack of information. Proceed directly to Stop 3.

Stop 3: Sol LeWitt – Tower (DC)

Orientation:
Continue walking through the lawn area until you come to a tall tower made of concrete blocks, arranged in a spiral and rising like a helix from the earth. This is Tower (DC) by Sol LeWitt.

Narration:
Sol LeWitt’s Tower (DC) exemplifies his commitment to conceptual minimalism. Constructed entirely from concrete blocks—uniform, gray, and devoid of ornament—the work spirals upward in a quiet, geometric crescendo.
LeWitt was a foundational figure in Conceptual Art. He believed that the idea behind a work was often more important than its physical execution. This tower, built from a set of instructions, could theoretically be reconstructed anywhere. Its true essence is the concept—the blueprint of the form—rather than the materials themselves.
Architecturally, Tower (DC) references ancient ziggurats and modernist silos. Artistically, it explores repetition, logic, and space. The spiral form invites both movement and contemplation, like a staircase you can’t climb.
Culturally, the work resists decoration, focusing instead on structure and process. It stands in contrast to organic forms around it, asserting human order within nature. Societally, LeWitt’s work democratizes art-making: anyone, in theory, could build this sculpture from his directions, removing the need for the “aura” of the artist’s hand.
Pause here to walk around the tower. Let your perspective shift. As with all of LeWitt’s work, part of the experience is how you choose to engage with its logic.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: walk downhill along the path to the left, passing under tall maples. You'll find a large bronze sculpture that appears both powerful and delicate, like an ancient vessel split open and stretched.

Stop 4: Ursula von Rydingsvard – Bronze Bowl with Lace

Orientation:
Walk further into the sculpture field until you see a monumental bronze sculpture resembling a massive cracked vessel with intricate perforations.

Narration:
This powerful form—Bronze Bowl with Lace by Ursula von Rydingsvard—is a poetic contradiction. It appears fragile, like a torn basket or ancient lacework, but is made from solid bronze.
Von Rydingsvard, born in Germany in a displaced persons camp and later immigrated to the U.S., channels personal memory and cultural trauma into her work. She begins with cedar beams, carving them into organic, expressive forms, then casts them in bronze—transforming impermanence into permanence.
This sculpture feels like a monument to resilience. Its scale invites reverence, while its delicacy invites intimacy. You might sense echoes of domestic vessels, feminine craft, or ancient ruins.
Artistically, von Rydingsvard’s process is deeply physical—she saws, hammers, and chisels with force. Yet the result is lyrical. Culturally, this piece honors craft traditions, particularly those passed down matrilineally. Societally, it speaks to survival and the reshaping of memory through material.
Walk slowly around the piece. Watch how light moves through the lace-like gaps. Feel the contrast between shadow and mass, roughness and grace.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: continue on the path past the bronze bowl, veering slightly right, and look for the bright steel arcs rising from the field—this is Musical Fence by Paul Matisse.

Stop 5: Paul Matisse – Musical Fence

Orientation:
Enter the open grassy area with a gentle slope. You’ll see a curved row of vertical aluminum bars arranged like a fence. These are musical—go ahead and strike them gently.

Narration:
This is Musical Fence by Paul Matisse, an interactive sound sculpture that invites you to become a participant. Each bar is tuned to a different pitch, allowing you to play it like a giant xylophone.
Matisse, grandson of painter Henri Matisse, is an inventor and sound artist whose work blends engineering with whimsy. He creates public art that responds to touch, wind, or sound.
This piece was originally envisioned for urban spaces—a fence you could play during your walk to work. It turns the mundane into something joyful. Artistically, it recalls the participatory art movements of the 1960s, where interactivity was key.
Culturally, it emphasizes accessibility and inclusivity. You don’t need to know anything about art to enjoy this. You just need to touch and listen. Societally, it offers an antidote to passive consumption—it invites engagement.
Let yourself play. Let children play. This fence was meant to be heard as well as seen.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: from the field, walk toward the cluster of tall pines behind the fence. You’ll find suspended organic forms hanging from trees—this is Pine Sharks by Nancy Winship Milliken.

Stop 6: Nancy Winship Milliken – Pine Sharks

Orientation:
Step beneath the pines, into a quiet wooded grove. Look up—you’ll see forms that resemble ghostly sharks made of natural fibers and hide, hanging from branches.

Narration:
Pine Sharks by Nancy Winship Milliken is a haunting blend of land art, environmental sculpture, and mythology. Made from rawhide, wool, and biodegradable materials, the forms resemble sharks swimming through forest air.
Milliken, who has a background in environmental science, creates site-responsive works that decay over time. Her materials are humble and local—farmed wool, bark, animal hide. Her themes, however, are profound: nature’s vulnerability, our fear of the wild, and the poetry of intrusion.
Artistically, this work fuses sculpture with performance. The elements—wind, rain, sun—are collaborators. Architecturally, it uses the trees as anchors. Culturally, the sharks recall folklore, dreams, and primal symbols of power.
Societally, Pine Sharks prompts us to reconsider our place in the ecosystem. Who’s really the predator? Who’s out of place?
Stand still. Let the wind move them. You’re inside the art now.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: exit the grove and walk toward the museum’s main lawn. On the left, you’ll see a shimmering metal sculpture gently rotating—this is Dancing with the Spheres by George Sherwood.

Stop 7: George Sherwood – Dancing with the Spheres

Orientation:
On the left side of the museum’s front lawn, you’ll spot this kinetic sculpture catching the wind and sun. It moves like a silent silver dancer.

Narration:
Dancing with the Spheres by George Sherwood is a marvel of engineering and elegance. Made from polished stainless steel, it rotates in the slightest breeze. Each spherical arm is counterbalanced and tuned, producing movement that mimics leaves, birds, or stars.
Sherwood trained at MIT and in theater set design before turning to sculpture. His works respond to their environment, creating silent ballets of form and wind.
Artistically, he descends from the lineage of kinetic artists like George Rickey. But Sherwood is unique in letting the sculpture’s motion be wholly dictated by nature—no motors, no tricks.
Culturally, this work underscores humanity’s delicate place within natural systems. Societally, it offers a meditative contrast to our overstimulated world.
Spend a few moments watching. This is not art to be rushed.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: walk uphill across the main lawn to the far side, where a tall spiral of colored glass beads rises—this is E=MC² by Jean-Michel Othoniel.

Stop 8: Jean-Michel Othoniel – E=MC²

Orientation:
Approach the vertical spiral sculpture composed of glass spheres. It stands like a beacon—glinting red, blue, silver, and gold.

Narration:
Jean-Michel Othoniel’s E=MC² is a meditation on energy, beauty, and mathematics. Composed of massive blown-glass beads on a steel spine, it evokes both scientific precision and spiritual symbolism.
The title references Einstein’s equation, but this is not a didactic piece. It’s about transformation—how matter becomes light, how ideas become form.
Othoniel, a French artist, often uses glass in site-specific installations. The materials are fragile, but the impact is immense. This spiral feels cosmic. It also echoes prayer beads, DNA strands, and baroque jewelry.
Artistically, Othoniel fuses abstraction with sensuality. Culturally, his use of ornament questions the divide between high and low art. Societally, the sculpture invites viewers to see reflection as a form of connection—you are part of this equation too.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the final stop once you reach it by following these directions: walk past the museum building toward the wooded back edge of the property. Among the trees you’ll find Little Red Riding Hood and Other Stories by Lesley Dill.

Stop 9: Lesley Dill – Little Red Riding Hood and Other Stories

Orientation:
This bronze figure sits quietly under trees, etched with text. It appears poetic and mythical. Get close to read the words on the surface.

Narration:
Lesley Dill’s Little Red Riding Hood and Other Stories blends sculpture, language, and memory. The form is human, but genderless, dreamlike.
Covered in poetry—some original, some from writers like Dickinson—this sculpture is a meditation on storytelling. It reimagines Little Red Riding Hood not as a victim, but as a seeker, a thinker, a symbol of transformation.
Dill is known for merging visual and literary traditions. She believes that language lives in the body, and her sculptures embody that principle.
Artistically, the figure is quiet but profound. Architecturally, it feels like a shrine. Culturally, it challenges old stories and offers new meanings. Societally, it invites us to reflect on whose stories endure, and why.
