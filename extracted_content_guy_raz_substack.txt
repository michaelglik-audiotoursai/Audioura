============================================================

If you’ve ever wandered into a big-box baby store and felt your heart rate spike, you’ll recognize the origin story of Babylist. Natalie Gordon wasn’t trying to build a billion-dollar brand. She was a new mom, writing code during nap time to solve her own problem: a modern registry that let you mix products from anywhere—and ask for practical help, like a month of diaper service or a friend to walk your dog. From there, she turned a side project into one of the most trusted registries in the U.S., with content, community, and a retail engine underneath. Here are the lessons that jumped out: 1) Build while you’re living it Natalie coded Babylist as a first-time parent. She knew exactly where the friction was—because she felt it. Lesson: When you’re the user, your product intuition is sharper and your feedback loops are immediate. Ship, test, fix. Repeat. 2) Start embarrassingly small—and relentlessly useful The MVP went live in ~30 days: a universal registry that looked modern and worked across retailers (and even non-product gifts). Lesson: A narrow tool that solves one painful job beats a wide but fuzzy “platform.” Make one promise and keep it. 3) Distribution is a to-do list, not a miracle Launch day wasn’t magic; it was email. Natalie forced herself to pitch 10 bloggers with custom demo registries tailored to each audience. Five wrote. One ranked on Google. Lesson: “Go-to-market” is earned with unglamorous reps: targeted outreach, specific angles, persistent follow-ups. 4) Talk to users like it’s your job—because it is Early on, Natalie answered every support email herself. She A/B-tested copy (e.g., “any quantity” vs. “no limit”) and pushed live changes the same day. Lesson: Customer service is product research in disguise. The fastest improvement path is inbox → code → live. 5) Define the bar that makes the leap rational She set a personal threshold—$3,000/month—as the signal to go full-time. Not a perfect spreadsheet. A clear trigger. Lesson: Create a simple, behavior-changing milestone. When you hit it, commit. 6) Be “slowly viral,” then add fuel Registries expose Babylist to 30–40 gift givers; some become the next parents. That’s compounding, not exploding. In 2015, Pinterest ads arrived—and Babylist’s curve bent. Lesson: Design for built-in exposure, then layer paid channels that match your demographic (and your payback window). 7) Own the moment, not the adjacent category The obvious expansion was weddings. Natalie said no. Instead, Babylist deepened its grip on the pregnancy-to-newborn window—with content, education, and later, health (breast pumps via insurance). Lesson: Category focus can be a moat. Dominate a life moment before you diversify. 8) Trade fragility for control—even if it hurts Affiliate revenue was great… and fragile. A few retailer relationships could jeopardize payroll. Babylist decided to sell and ship products itself. It was messy: taxes in every state, returns, discontinued SKUs, warehouses between desks. Lesson: Sometimes you take on operational pain to de-risk the business. Verticalizing is hard—but resilience is a strategy. 9) Upgrade yourself as the company upgrades Natalie will tell you the grind was learning to lead—hiring, letting people go, and getting a coach who turned feedback into weekly reps. Lesson: Founders don’t “become” CEOs. They practice their way there. Treat management like a craft with drills, not vibes. What I love about this story It’s a masterclass in non-obvious compounding : tiny SEO wins, “nap-time” shipping, slowly viral mechanics, then a single paid channel unlock. It’s a reminder that business models are risk profiles . Affiliate is clean until it isn’t. Retail is hard until it compounds. And it’s proof that timing + grind beats perfect vision: the Kindle/Prime-era Amazon training, the Lean Startup reset, COVID’s shock—each met with a practical move.

Babylist: The $500M Naptime Side Project Listen on Spotify Listen on Apple Natalie Gordon was pregnant, broke, and staring at an aisle of pink-and-blue giraffes that made her want to scream. In 2010, she had a simple wish: a baby registry that wasn’t trapped inside a single store. One that could include anything – from strollers to diaper services, while you figured out how to keep a tiny human alive. Nothing like that existed. So she built it herself. During naptimes she coded the MVP and in 2011, Natalie launched Babylist . The early numbers were laughable: $140 in two months! But compared to her previous projects, it felt like momentum. She could have never predicted what happened next: A move to Silicon Valley. A painful first firing. A fragile business model. And decisions that nearly destroyed the company. This is the story of how a frustrated mom turned nap time code into one of America’s most trusted parenting platforms. And why controlling your destiny sometimes means choosing the hardest path. HIBT Advice Line: The Long Journey Ahead Listen on Spotify Listen on Apple This week on the Advice Line, I’m joined by Tariq Farid, founder of Edible Arrangements . After handing the CEO role to his daughter, Tariq knows how to evolve without losing your soul. First up, Jake: How do I make banana ketchup mainstream in America? Jake’s Fila Manila has Filipino-inspired products in Walmart and Whole Foods, but Americans don’t know what banana ketchup is. We urged him to make it his hero product and rally everything around it. Put the origin story front-and-center on packaging. Next, Heather: Should I keep “Cruises” in my luxury expedition company name? Heather’s Minimal Impact Cruises is launching a 36-passenger solar-powered polar vessel. But she is struggling to figure out how to market to the masses. Our advice: test, don’t guess. Run A/B ads and optimize for qualified leads. Finally, Ryan: How do I grow from $3M to $5M without losing our personal touch? Ryan built Kong Screen Printing to $3M with nearly zero paid marketing. But he’s ready to take it to the next level. Tariq’s guidance: mine the gold you already own. Create a Brand Bible so growth doesn’t dilute the experience. Tariq leaves us with this: Building anything meaningful is a 10-year journey . Most founders over-index on risk and stall. Ship the experience that makes people smile, and the brand will take care of itself.
