Orientation:
This bronze figure sits quietly under trees, etched with text. It appears poetic and mythical. Get close to read the words on the surface.

Narration:
Lesley Dill’s Little Red Riding Hood and Other Stories blends sculpture, language, and memory. The form is human, but genderless, dreamlike.
Covered in poetry—some original, some from writers like Dickinson—this sculpture is a meditation on storytelling. It reimagines Little Red Riding Hood not as a victim, but as a seeker, a thinker, a symbol of transformation.
Dill is known for merging visual and literary traditions. She believes that language lives in the body, and her sculptures embody that principle.
Artistically, the figure is quiet but profound. Architecturally, it feels like a shrine. Culturally, it challenges old stories and offers new meanings. Societally, it invites us to reflect on whose stories endure, and why.

✅ This concludes the Outdoor Sculpture Park Tour.
