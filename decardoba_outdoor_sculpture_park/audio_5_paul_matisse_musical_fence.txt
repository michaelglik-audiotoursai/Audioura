Orientation:
Enter the open grassy area with a gentle slope. You’ll see a curved row of vertical aluminum bars arranged like a fence. These are musical—go ahead and strike them gently.

Narration:
This is Musical Fence by Paul Matisse, an interactive sound sculpture that invites you to become a participant. Each bar is tuned to a different pitch, allowing you to play it like a giant xylophone.
Matisse, grandson of painter Henri Matisse, is an inventor and sound artist whose work blends engineering with whimsy. He creates public art that responds to touch, wind, or sound.
This piece was originally envisioned for urban spaces—a fence you could play during your walk to work. It turns the mundane into something joyful. Artistically, it recalls the participatory art movements of the 1960s, where interactivity was key.
Culturally, it emphasizes accessibility and inclusivity. You don’t need to know anything about art to enjoy this. You just need to touch and listen. Societally, it offers an antidote to passive consumption—it invites engagement.
Let yourself play. Let children play. This fence was meant to be heard as well as seen.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: from the field, walk toward the cluster of tall pines behind the fence. You’ll find suspended organic forms hanging from trees—this is Pine Sharks by Nancy Winship Milliken.
