Orientation:
Walk further into the sculpture field until you see a monumental bronze sculpture resembling a massive cracked vessel with intricate perforations.

Narration:
This powerful form—Bronze Bowl with Lace by Ursula von Rydingsvard—is a poetic contradiction. It appears fragile, like a torn basket or ancient lacework, but is made from solid bronze.
Von Rydingsvard, born in Germany in a displaced persons camp and later immigrated to the U.S., channels personal memory and cultural trauma into her work. She begins with cedar beams, carving them into organic, expressive forms, then casts them in bronze—transforming impermanence into permanence.
This sculpture feels like a monument to resilience. Its scale invites reverence, while its delicacy invites intimacy. You might sense echoes of domestic vessels, feminine craft, or ancient ruins.
Artistically, von Rydingsvard’s process is deeply physical—she saws, hammers, and chisels with force. Yet the result is lyrical. Culturally, this piece honors craft traditions, particularly those passed down matrilineally. Societally, it speaks to survival and the reshaping of memory through material.
Walk slowly around the piece. Watch how light moves through the lace-like gaps. Feel the contrast between shadow and mass, roughness and grace.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: continue on the path past the bronze bowl, veering slightly right, and look for the bright steel arcs rising from the field—this is Musical Fence by Paul Matisse.
