Orientation:
Approach the vertical spiral sculpture composed of glass spheres. It stands like a beacon—glinting red, blue, silver, and gold.

Narration:
Jean-Michel Othoniel’s E=MC² is a meditation on energy, beauty, and mathematics. Composed of massive blown-glass beads on a steel spine, it evokes both scientific precision and spiritual symbolism.
The title references Einstein’s equation, but this is not a didactic piece. It’s about transformation—how matter becomes light, how ideas become form.
Othoniel, a French artist, often uses glass in site-specific installations. The materials are fragile, but the impact is immense. This spiral feels cosmic. It also echoes prayer beads, DNA strands, and baroque jewelry.
Artistically, Othoniel fuses abstraction with sensuality. Culturally, his use of ornament questions the divide between high and low art. Societally, the sculpture invites viewers to see reflection as a form of connection—you are part of this equation too.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the final stop once you reach it by following these directions: walk past the museum building toward the wooded back edge of the property. Among the trees you’ll find Little Red Riding Hood and Other Stories by Lesley Dill.
