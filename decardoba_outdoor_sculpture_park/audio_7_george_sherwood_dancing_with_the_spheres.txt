Orientation:
On the left side of the museum’s front lawn, you’ll spot this kinetic sculpture catching the wind and sun. It moves like a silent silver dancer.

Narration:
Dancing with the Spheres by George Sherwood is a marvel of engineering and elegance. Made from polished stainless steel, it rotates in the slightest breeze. Each spherical arm is counterbalanced and tuned, producing movement that mimics leaves, birds, or stars.
Sherwood trained at MIT and in theater set design before turning to sculpture. His works respond to their environment, creating silent ballets of form and wind.
Artistically, he descends from the lineage of kinetic artists like George Rickey. But Sherwood is unique in letting the sculpture’s motion be wholly dictated by nature—no motors, no tricks.
Culturally, this work underscores humanity’s delicate place within natural systems. Societally, it offers a meditative contrast to our overstimulated world.
Spend a few moments watching. This is not art to be rushed.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: walk uphill across the main lawn to the far side, where a tall spiral of colored glass beads rises—this is E=MC² by Jean-Michel Othoniel.
