Orientation:
Step beneath the pines, into a quiet wooded grove. Look up—you’ll see forms that resemble ghostly sharks made of natural fibers and hide, hanging from branches.

Narration:
Pine Sharks by Nancy Winship Milliken is a haunting blend of land art, environmental sculpture, and mythology. Made from rawhide, wool, and biodegradable materials, the forms resemble sharks swimming through forest air.
Milliken, who has a background in environmental science, creates site-responsive works that decay over time. Her materials are humble and local—farmed wool, bark, animal hide. Her themes, however, are profound: nature’s vulnerability, our fear of the wild, and the poetry of intrusion.
Artistically, this work fuses sculpture with performance. The elements—wind, rain, sun—are collaborators. Architecturally, it uses the trees as anchors. Culturally, the sharks recall folklore, dreams, and primal symbols of power.
Societally, Pine Sharks prompts us to reconsider our place in the ecosystem. Who’s really the predator? Who’s out of place?
Stand still. Let the wind move them. You’re inside the art now.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: exit the grove and walk toward the museum’s main lawn. On the left, you’ll see a shimmering metal sculpture gently rotating—this is Dancing with the Spheres by George Sherwood.
