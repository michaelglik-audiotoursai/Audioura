Orientation:
Begin your tour at the main entrance to deCordova’s Sculpture Park. Step onto the paved path leading from the front of the museum building. Directly ahead of you, you’ll see two towering bronze hearts—bold, black, and looming with texture.

Narration:
These massive sculptures, Two Big Black Hearts by Jim Dine, set the tone for your exploration of the Sculpture Park. At first glance, they seem like Valentine’s Day icons gone monumental—but there’s much more than sentimentality here.
Jim Dine, an American artist affiliated loosely with the Pop Art movement, has spent decades exploring everyday symbols—hearts, robes, tools—and imbuing them with deeply personal and psychological resonance. These hearts are not slick or pretty; they’re rough, scarred, and deeply textured. They speak to love, yes, but also to labor, grief, endurance, and the physicality of making.
Standing between them, you might feel dwarfed or embraced—or both. Their scale invites you to consider the monumental weight of emotion and the space it occupies in the public realm. Dine’s hearts, unlike sweet confections or digital icons, have heft and presence.
Culturally, the heart symbol is nearly universal—but here, Dine strips it of cliché and returns it to something primal and sculptural. Societally, these forms suggest that emotion, particularly love, deserves not just expression but permanence. They endure like bronze memorials to feeling itself.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: follow the path downhill and to the right, where you'll find a tall, rusted steel wall curving through the landscape—this is Berlin Wall Section by unknown artists, imported as a historical artifact.
