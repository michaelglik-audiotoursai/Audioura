Orientation:
Continue walking through the lawn area until you come to a tall tower made of concrete blocks, arranged in a spiral and rising like a helix from the earth. This is Tower (DC) by Sol LeWitt.

Narration:
Sol LeWitt’s Tower (DC) exemplifies his commitment to conceptual minimalism. Constructed entirely from concrete blocks—uniform, gray, and devoid of ornament—the work spirals upward in a quiet, geometric crescendo.
LeWitt was a foundational figure in Conceptual Art. He believed that the idea behind a work was often more important than its physical execution. This tower, built from a set of instructions, could theoretically be reconstructed anywhere. Its true essence is the concept—the blueprint of the form—rather than the materials themselves.
Architecturally, Tower (DC) references ancient ziggurats and modernist silos. Artistically, it explores repetition, logic, and space. The spiral form invites both movement and contemplation, like a staircase you can’t climb.
Culturally, the work resists decoration, focusing instead on structure and process. It stands in contrast to organic forms around it, asserting human order within nature. Societally, LeWitt’s work democratizes art-making: anyone, in theory, could build this sculpture from his directions, removing the need for the “aura” of the artist’s hand.
Pause here to walk around the tower. Let your perspective shift. As with all of LeWitt’s work, part of the experience is how you choose to engage with its logic.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: walk downhill along the path to the left, passing under tall maples. You'll find a large bronze sculpture that appears both powerful and delicate, like an ancient vessel split open and stretched.
