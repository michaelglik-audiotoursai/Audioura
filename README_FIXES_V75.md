# Audio Tours - Critical Fixes

## Version 1.0.0+75

This update fixes critical issues with the background tour generation:

1. **Fixed Database Connection**:
   - Corrected the database host name in the tour orchestrator service
   - Added debug scripts to test database connections
   - Fixed the issue preventing tours from being stored in the database

2. **Fixed Background Tour Notifications**:
   - Restored notification functionality for completed background tours
   - Ensured proper notification flow

3. **Fixed Auto-Download Functionality**:
   - Fixed the issue where background tours weren't automatically downloaded
   - Restored the functionality to move completed tours to "My Tours"

## How to Deploy

1. Run the fix script to update the tour orchestrator service:
   ```bash
   fix_background_service.bat
   ```

2. Build and install the mobile app:
   ```
   copy ..\pubspec_android_simple.yaml pubspec.yaml
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Generate a tour in the background
2. Wait for it to complete
3. Verify that:
   - You receive a notification when the tour is complete
   - The tour is automatically downloaded
   - The tour appears in "My Tours" page
   - The tour is removed from the background jobs list
   - The tour is stored in the database

## Database Check

You can verify that tours are being stored in the database with:

```sql
SELECT tour_name, request_string, lat, lng, number_requested FROM audio_tours;
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:
1. Run the database connection test:
   ```bash
   test_db_connection.bat
   ```

2. Check the Docker logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs tour-orchestrator
   ```
