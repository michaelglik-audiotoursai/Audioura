# REQ-016: UUID Tour Download with New Tour ID

## Problem
When editing UUID tours, backend creates a NEW tour with changes, but mobile app doesn't know the new tour ID to download. User sees no changes after editing.

## Current Broken Flow
1. Edit UUID tour `b2561a69-feff-409d-806b-f7a09efbb745`
2. Backend creates new tour with changes (new UUID)
3. Mobile app tries to download old UUID (no changes)
4. User sees no changes

## Required Solution
Backend must return the **new tour ID** in save response so mobile app can download the correct updated tour.

## API Changes Needed

### 1. Update Save Response
**Endpoint**: `POST /tour/{uuid}/update-multiple-stops`

**Current Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Bulk update completed",
  "job_ids": ["job-123", "job-456"]
}
```

**Required Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Bulk update completed", 
  "job_ids": ["job-123", "job-456"],
  "new_tour_id": "c3672b7a-8f00-4e0e-917c-g8b10fcc8856",
  "download_url": "/tour/c3672b7a-8f00-4e0e-917c-g8b10fcc8856/download"
}
```

### 2. Add UUID Tour Download Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `GET /tour/{uuid}/download`

**Response**: ZIP file with updated tour files

## Mobile App Changes
Mobile app will use `new_tour_id` from save response to download the correct updated tour instead of the original UUID.

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - UUID tour editing is completely broken without this fix.

## Test Case
1. Edit UUID tour `b2561a69-feff-409d-806b-f7a09efbb745`
2. Save changes
3. Response should include `new_tour_id`
4. Mobile app downloads new tour ID
5. User sees changes in Listen Page

## Implementation Notes
- If no new tour created (no changes), return original UUID
- Ensure download endpoint works for both original and new UUIDs
- Consider tour versioning for future multi-version support
