Orientation:
Stand with your back to the dawn redwood and face the water spigot nestled within a grove of evergreens.
Narration:
he dawn redwood we just met moves water through their tree-body, drawing it up from the soil to support and energize their cells, before sending it out into the air (i.e. transpiration). Our human bodies also hold, circulate, and transmit water.


To keep water (nupee) close at hand, humans engineer complex systems for storing and moving it around. From the dawn redwood, walk further into campus towards a tall grove of evergreen trees. There you will find a water spigot that is a portal to one such system. Stand with your back to the dawn redwood, facing the spigot. Just downhill to your left, out of sight behind the trees, sits the town’s drinking water treatment plant. Here water is filtered, treated, and made safer for humans to consume before being pushed into a series of subterranean pipes. The main waterline (a 12” wide pipe) is buried under the road you drove on to get here. A smaller 8” wide pipe comes off that main line, then increasingly fine branches bring water to this spigot and further into deCordova, where it splashes into sinks and flushes toilets in the store, studios, and museum. To get to the offices on the top floor of the museum, water needs to be pumped hundreds of feet above the treatment plant. Gravity pulls “wastewater” from the museum back down through drains and pipes into a large holding tank. Solids settle out in the tank for later removal, while water is released into a leach field beneath the parking lot filter further downward into the soil.

Bring your fingers to your neck, touching lightly just below your jawbone. Feel for your pulse. If you’re comfortable doing so, close your eyes and connect with the liquid pumping through your body. Your body is at least half water- and the blood in your veins is mostly water.
Just as trees pump water from soil to sky, so do humans engineer their own systems for water movement. The spigot here connects to a hidden infrastructure: water drawn from Lincoln’s nearby treatment plant, pumped uphill through pipes, then distributed to sinks, studios, and restrooms across deCordova.
You are water, too—over half of your body. Touch your neck and feel your pulse: your own personal plumbing system. In this stop, Ellie Irons and Aubrie James ask us to recognize the poetry and politics of water circulation—across tree, body, and institution.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by walking across the South Lawn. Make your way to the tree line and find the hidden trail leading down to a stone barn foundation.
