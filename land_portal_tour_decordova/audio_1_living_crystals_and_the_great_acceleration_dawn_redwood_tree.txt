Orientation:
Start at the entry sign near the deCordova main entrance. Walk slightly downslope until you reach the tall, soft-needled dawn redwood tree beside the path.
Narration:
This dawn redwood is a particularly beautiful example of what some might call a “living crystal.” In geology, crystals are defined as inorganic (non-living) materials that have a certain molecular structure. Like nearly all plants on Earth, this tree combines crystals with starlight, air, and water (nupee) to build the sugars and starches that make up its leaves, bark, roots, and trunk. Despite its slow nature, standing next to the dawn redwood, you are in the presence of a strange, lively, and ongoing performance.


The presence of this plant also gives us special clues about deCordova’s ecosystem. This species is a “living fossil” not native to Massachusetts. Originating from China, it was thought to be extinct until it was discovered by Chinese botanists in the 1940s. Scientists from Harvard University took interest and brought the dawn redwood to the United States. Now, this species is planted as an ornamental tree (muhtuq) all over the world.

Such rapid, intercontinental species exchange is a hallmark of what is sometimes called the great acceleration, or the increase in human activity since the mid-20th century and its effects on planetary systems. As you will see at deCordova, ecosystems in the time of the great acceleration are quite distinct from ecosystems in the past.

To open the first part of the portal, do these in order:

gently touch the bark of the tree. Try to sense exactly where light from the sun—a star (anaquhs)—reaches your skin. Seek out and touch a nearby rock. Notice your breath in and out. Reach down and feel the moist grass or soil. Sun, stone, breath, water—these are the raw ingredients that plants use to grow and live.
This dawn redwood isn’t just ornamental—it’s a time-traveling witness. Once thought extinct, it was rediscovered in China in the 1940s and brought to the U.S. by Harvard botanists. As a “living fossil,” it symbolizes both prehistoric persistence and modern ecological disruption.
The artists call it a “living crystal,” channeling sunlight, minerals, and water to build its tissues. This tree reflects the age of the Great Acceleration—the modern surge in global interconnection and ecological change since the mid-20th century. Trees like this move water through their trunks and air through their leaves—quietly altering our atmosphere. In touching its bark and the stone beside it, you’re entering the world of slow, living time.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by continuing forward to the grove of evergreens and locate the visible water spigot on your right.
