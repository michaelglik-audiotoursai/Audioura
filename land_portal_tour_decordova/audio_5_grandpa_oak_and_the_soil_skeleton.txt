Orientation:
In the sunny upland meadow, locate the large white oak tree near the top of the hill overlooking the reservoir.
Narration:
As you meander into your walk through the open and sunny upland meadow, try to spot slivers of the pond (nupuhsupâq) through the woods (tawahkamuq). Is the water sparkling with sunlight? Is it reflecting what is in the sky (keesuq), like a mirror?
In contrast to the low, bowl-shaped detention basin, the slope you stand on now is steep; rainwater doesn’t necessarily have time to percolate into the soil. Instead, it races down the hill into the reservoir below. This leads to erosion - the wearing away of the soil on the slope - which both re-shapes the land and brings soil particles to the water down below.
In addition to being pollinator-friendly and a nice nesting place for the resident snapping turtles, the plants in the oak-dotted meadow you are walking through were planted as erosion buffers. The roots of the plants in this meadow stabilize the soil, acting like a great underground skeleton holding the soil in place. This skeleton protects the pond, which is the main source of drinking water for Lincoln, Massachusetts.
White oaks like this one (Quercus alba) are native to Massachusetts and are the most common tree species at deCordova. Big oaks have silently presided over many of the changes to the landscape—from forest, to lawn, to meadow—stabilizing the ground they grow in, that in turn stabilizes and nourishes them.

Place one hand on the oak and face the reservoir, planting yourself in place. Imagine yourself as a branch of this old oak, growing strong and tall over the last 200 years. As you slowly stretch your other arm out and let it sway in the wind, imagine what sorts of changes you have witnessed through your life, standing and growing here over the last two centuries. What plants, animals (awâahsak), and people have passed under your leafy canopy?

This venerable white oak is more than a tree—it’s a soil stabilizer, a habitat anchor, and a witness to centuries of landscape change. The roots of meadow plants and oaks like this one form an underground skeleton, holding the soil in place and protecting the water supply below. 
This slope drains directly into the pond, Lincoln’s drinking source. Without plant roots, soil would erode downhill. The oak watches over all of it—forest, lawn, meadow—quietly reinforcing the balance between ground and growth, between history and habitat.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by walking to the isolated boulder near the ridge crest ahead of you.
