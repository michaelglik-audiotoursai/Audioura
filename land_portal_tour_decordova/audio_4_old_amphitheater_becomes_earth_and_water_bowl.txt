Orientation:
Exit the barn foundation from the opposite corner. Follow the conservation path up and over the wooded hillside until you find a bench overlooking a wide depression in the earth.
Narration:
Exit the barn foundation from the opposite corner of where you entered. Walk along the conservation land path along the perimeter of deCordova’s property up and over the wooded hillside, where you will find a bench.
Take a seat on the bench. Let yourself settle. Remember your pulse and the liquids circulating in your body. Sink into the bench, feel the tug of gravity, and try to connect to the liquid world inside you.
Now shift your attention to the land around you. In front of you sits a large bowl carved into the earth (ahkee). This used to be an amphitheater, but now has another life as a “detention basin”. It collects and holds water (nupee) so it can be released gradually. During heavy rain (s8kunôn) events (which are increasingly likely with climate change) water runs over the surface of the land, collecting wherever it can come to rest. The water that collects here comes from the east side of deCordova’s campus, draining off of hard surfaces like roads, buildings, and parking lots.
After water settles in the basin, it gradually moves on to other destinations: some water evaporates into the air, some is transferred to the wetlands below the parking lot, and some of it sinks down into the soil right here, trickling into an underground network of water held in gaps in soil and rocks. This underground water network is known as groundwater. About 30 percent of all readily available freshwater on the planet (mutâahk) is groundwater.

Find your way to the edge of the basin in front of the bench. Move along its border, looking down at the plants growing below. How many shapes and textures can you see? These plants help trap pollutants, preventing them from entering the groundwater supply. Thank the plants for acting as filter and protector of our groundwater, adapting themselves to thrive in this human-made water system. Moisture-loving plants you might see in the basin include sensitive fern, cattail, sedge, and white vervain.

This bowl-shaped basin used to be an amphitheater. Today, it holds water runoff during storms—an engineered “detention basin” designed for climate resilience. It collects water from paved surfaces like parking lots and roofs, allowing it to soak back into the soil or flow into surrounding wetlands. 
As you sit, reflect on the network of flows around and within you—your pulse, the trickle of groundwater, the pull of gravity. Water always moves. Plants here like cattails and sedges help filter pollutants before they reach the groundwater below.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by walking across the upland meadow and finding the large white oak tree facing the reservoir.
