Orientation:
Climb the stone steps up to the rocky ridge. Stand with your hand on the largest exposed slab of bedrock—this is Alice’s Garden.
Narration:
Walk up the steps of this rocky ridge to find the next portal activation point:
This particular piece of bedrock is already an open portal. If you close your eyes and hold your hand on this rock, you should be able to connect to the time when it was formed, about 430 millions years ago.

Suddenly, your body is under immense pressure. You are growing warmer and warmer, now sweating, now boiling up, now melting, as you are surrounded by, and become, liquid heat. Looking up, you see only darkness. You are under a mountain—thousands of feet of pure rock —but the material directly around you is hot and liquified. Magma.

Slowly, over millions of years, you begin to cool, transforming. You come to rest in the very core of the mountain, but the surface of the mountain far above is subject to the power of water and wind. It slowly erodes. As time passes, you think you hear the faint whistling of the wind and—is that the vibration of raindrops reverberating through the mountain?

As time passes, you age into an old, old, old earth ancestor—hundreds of millions of years old. The mountain shield protecting you has eroded into a gently sloping landscape. Still, you remain tucked inside—in the core, in the dark.

Only a few years ago, a glacier grew, and grew, and grew. As it moved, it scraped across the surface of what was left of your old, protective mountaintop, removing it in some places completely. All of a sudden, you could feel the wind on your surface, and the cold rain (s8kunôn) as it hit your rocky skin. Eventually, you began to feel the peculiar sensation of mosses and lichens growing in the cracks of your stony exterior.

In what seems like just yesterday, you came to be called Alice’s Garden by the current inhabitants (wâtahkeecheek) of the surface. But your real name is much older, and stranger—and can only be pronounced by the landscape, over millions of years.

You're touching something 430 million years old. This bedrock was once at the heart of a massive mountain, formed under intense heat and pressure. Over eons, wind, rain, and glacier slowly stripped away the mountain, revealing the rock where you now stand. 
Close your eyes and imagine the magma, the darkness, the mountain shielding you. Now feel the moss, the breeze, the lichens—this is time, exposed. The artists invite you to become the rock, to remember what it is to be very old.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next and final stop once you reach it by stepping forward onto the flat terrace space near the highest point of the campus.
