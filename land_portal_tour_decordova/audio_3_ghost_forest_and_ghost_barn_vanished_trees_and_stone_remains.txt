Orientation:
Enter the South Lawn and walk its length to find a narrow trail. Follow it downhill to the remnants of a stone barn foundation in the forest.
Narration:
With the map as your guide, make your way to and across the South Lawn. This elongated clearing is carefully constructed to create a deep line of sight. More than four hundred years ago, this land was densely forested, and tree giants stood here, obstructing the view. Can you see or feel their ghosts? At the far edge of the lawn, find the hidden trail and follow it to the lowest point on our walk: the sunken foundation of what used to be a barn.


By the mid-1800s, up to 80% of these mature forests (tawahkamuq) were gone, cleared by settlers to create agricultural fields. Today most of those fields have fallen out of use. Forests have returned to much of the land, but they are not the ancient, robust forests nurtured by Indigenous people including the Wampanoag before colonization. Rather, they are middle-aged forests, a mixture of migrant and native trees living together in a changing climate.


As you consider what it’s like to be a middle-aged tree in an ever-changing patch of forest, notice the stone structure that surrounds you. Stones are omnipresent here at deCordova. The soil is riddled with them. The freeze / thaw cycle pushes these stones to the surface, birthing them onto the land where they present themselves as material for human infrastructure projects. At the same time early settlers were felling the trees who used to stand here, they were also hauling stones. They built barns, houses, and the myriad rock walls that crisscross the land. They divided the land into pasture and field, privatizing and commodifying these spaces for production. Now the stone structures linger, their utility outlived, providing a surface for lichens and moss, who contribute to their gradual decay.

Stand in the center of the barn foundation, and scan along the edges of the foundation at eye level. When something catches your eye, move closer for a careful look.

Look for :
false stones, true stones, & stones embraced by plants
stones split by weather, stones with layers & stones that sparkle in the sun
Imagine the labor that lifted and placed these stones, and the forces that will undo them.

This sunken rectangle of stone marks the footprint of a long-gone barn. Before settlers cleared this land for agriculture, towering forests once stood here. That landscape was erased—but its ghosts remain in the trees returning to this place. What you see now is a “middle-aged forest,” not the old-growth nurtured by Indigenous stewards like the Wampanoag. 
The barn’s stones, dug from the soil and stacked by settlers, reflect the conversion of land into labor. Lichens and mosses now soften their edges, but the story they tell—of extraction, division, and the privatizing of place—still echoes through the earth.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by continuing along the path up and over the wooded hill until you reach a bench beside a wide earthen basin.
