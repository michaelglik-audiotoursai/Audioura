Orientation:
Step onto the wide, open terrace at the summit of deCordova’s landscape. Face the sky and let the space expand around you.
Narration:
Please be aware, the Sculpture Terrace is occassionally closed during park hours for private events. Please check with any museum staff member for more details on access during your visit.

Leaving bedrock behind, enter this final stop with your face raised to the sky. Contemplate the beings you’ve met on this walk. The trees and grasses, the lichens and mosses, the boulders, stones and pebbles—they are all combinations of air, crystals, starlight, and water (nupee). So are you!

Imagine the strength of the sun beaming down on your skin, energizing your body. This warmth is followed by a gathering wind that portends a storm. Storm clouds roll in, and drama unfolds through your little window to the sky. Soon a crack of thunder (patahqahan), a flash of lightning (ukuchâmun), and the first rain (s8kunôn) drops begin to splatter across your cheeks, nose, and forehead. As those drops trickle across your skin, other drops hit the top branches of the dawn redwood and the white oak, and begin to stream downward on twigs and branches. Other droplets splatter on rock, bare soil, lawn, meadow. You stand on the highest land on the deCordova campus. As the storm builds, water begins to puddle, pool, and flow around your feet. Gravity pulls the water from high to low. Where the ground is porous and open, some water percolates right into the ground, working its way downward towards bedrock. Where the ground is hard and flat, it gathers in puddles that eventually overflow and rush downward towards the pond on one side and the detention basin on the other. Some of this water is absorbed to support the living-crystal bodies of plants, some will get pumped into the pipes that supply water for our drinking and bathing, and some will rise back into the air, enlivening the atmosphere.

Walk in a spiral along the edge of this wide, flat surface—a human-made plateau. Pause in the center, and orient yourself. Take a deep breath in, and let your lungs, chest, and belly swell. Then let the air out with a big “WOOOSH”. Next, raise this booklet over your head and use the hole in this page to frame the sky (keesuq). Let the paper block out the rest of the world, and focus your gaze. Breathe.

This is where it all converges—air, water, stone, time, and you. You are standing at the high point of the park, and from here, water will eventually flow in all directions: into soil, into pipes, into bodies—into the world. 
You, too, are made of starlight, minerals, air, and water. You are not simply on the land. You are the land—alive, breathing, transforming. This final stop invites you to center yourself, breathe deeply, and feel the storm gathering in your veins, your breath, and the sky.
Transition (Closing):
This concludes your Land Portal journey. Feel free to revisit any stop or reflect on your own pathways as you return to the museum or explore other sculptures. You have not just walked across the land—you have traveled through time and being, becoming the portal yourself.
