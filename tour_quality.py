"""Score a generated tour against the defects Michael has actually reported.

Michael, 2026-09-21: *"at some point I will rely on your judgement and the
described 3 steps can be done by you automatically informing me but not continue
without my permission unless I stop you. How can we make this happen?"*

The three steps are: generate a batch → notice one is much better → diagnose and
fix → regenerate. The loop cannot run itself while a human is the only instrument,
so this is the instrument. It measures ONLY defects with an objective signature —
every one of them something Michael found by reading and then had to explain:

  no_story        zero named people (Logan, three rounds running)
  thin            fewer stops delivered than requested (the Pulpit, D578)
  truncated       "Founded in 1868 by St." / "engaged of Public Works"
  repeated        the same episode told at two stops (Mother Teresa)
  refuted         a bound place too far away (Archbishop of Los Angeles, D577)
  bare_death      a named violent death with no circumstances
  distance        a kilometre figure on a building tour

**What it deliberately cannot judge: whether a tour is INTERESTING.** That is the
thing Michael reads for, and no counter substitutes for it. The loop is therefore
allowed to iterate on measurable defects and must hand the judgement call back.
