# Tour Orchestrator Service Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed
1. Missing `psycopg2` module in the Docker container
2. Container running with incorrect name
3. Container not connected to the correct network

## Steps Taken
1. Added `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9` to `requirements-orchestrator.txt`
2. Created a Docker Compose file specifically for the tour orchestrator
3. Configured the container to use the `development_default` network
4. Started the container using Docker Compose
5. Verified the container is running properly and responding to health checks

## Files Created/Modified
- Created `docker-compose-tour-orchestrator.yml` for the tour orchestrator service
- Created `restart_tour_orchestrator.bat` to easily restart the service
- Updated `requirements-orchestrator.txt` to include `psycopg2-binary`

## Verification
- Container is running with the correct name: `development-tour-orchestrator-1`
- Container is connected to the `development_default` network
- Container has the network alias `tour-orchestrator`
- Health check endpoint returns "healthy" status
- No more `ModuleNotFoundError` for `psycopg2`

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the container for any further issues
2. Consider adding these dependencies to the Dockerfile directly
3. Update documentation to reflect the correct container name and network
