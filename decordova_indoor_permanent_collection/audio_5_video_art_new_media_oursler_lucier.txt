Orientation:
Enter a dimmed room with two screens and low ambient sound. A projected face floats ahead; a multi-screen installation shimmers to your right.

Narration:
Tony Oursler’s installation features a projected, disembodied face emerging from a soft form—splicing voice and vision into an eerie, intimate performance. Oursler explores how media shapes identity, memory, and myth.
Mary Lucier’s multi-screen piece loops footage of landscapes, tide pools, or crumbling ruins—sped up, slowed down, re-textured. Her work feels like a living painting—poetic and environmental. Lucier’s pioneering approach to video lets time breathe, to pulse, and to fade.
This room is less about looking, more about feeling. Video art invites you to sit, close your eyes, listen, and see inside yourself.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by exiting this room and taking the stairs back to the rooftop gallery.
