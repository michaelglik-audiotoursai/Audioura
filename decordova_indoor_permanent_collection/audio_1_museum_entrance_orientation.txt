Orientation:
Stand just inside the front doors on Sandy Pond Road in the grand entry hall. Ahead of you is a broad terrazzo stairway that leads up to the galleries—the threshold between old mansion and modern museum.

Narration:
Welcome to the deCordova Museum. This entry hall, redesigned in 1998 by Kallmann McKinnell & Wood, is a beautiful blend of past and present. Beneath your feet, you’ll notice the terrazzo flooring—a smooth, polished surface that transitions seamlessly from the old to the new. Above, skylights pull daylight deep into the building, lighting your path upward.
Originally Julian de Cordova’s private estate, these spaces have been transformed into something public, democratic, and forward-looking. That transformation is literal in the architecture—and metaphorical in the deCordova mission: honoring history while making bold space for contemporary creativity.
Today, you’re stepping into a museum that cares about legacy—but also about what happens next. Notice how the older masonry meets sleek steel handrails. The mood is welcoming, contemplative, and energetic.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by ascending the central stairs and turning right into the first permanent galleries.
