Orientation:
Ascend one level to the rooftop. You’ll enter a bright space with panoramic windows framing Flint’s Pond and the sculpture park beyond.

Narration:
Barbara Takenaga’s cosmic painting is a swirl of dots, spirals, and shimmering color—evoking galaxies or microscopic life. A New England-based artist, Takenaga crosses boundaries between science, spirituality, and abstraction.
Roger Phillips’ wood relief feels alive—the grain almost moves, shining like waves when light passes over it. Phillips, trained as an architect, brings biomorphic design and attention to sustainable woods.
Anila Quayyum Agha’s laser-cut wood panels float nearby, casting intricate shadows like mandalas across the floor. Agha merges Islamic geometry with patterns of light, offering quiet meditation and cultural fusion.
Here, art meets nature. Sky, water, light, and form embraced through diverse mediums.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by descending to the ground floor and entering the “Material Transformations” gallery to your left.
