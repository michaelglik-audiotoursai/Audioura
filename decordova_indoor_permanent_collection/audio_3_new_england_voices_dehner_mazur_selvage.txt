Orientation:
Proceed into the adjoining gallery. The walls display a mix of paintings and sculpture by artists rooted in the New England region.

Narration:
This gallery is an exploration of place, identity, and creative transformation in the region. Dorothy Dehner’s White Shadow uses bold abstract forms that evoke urban landscapes and psychological tension—she transitioned from figurative to abstract in the 1950s and emerged as a voice of American Modernism.
Nearby, Michael Mazur’s expressive prints confront moral and social themes—his prison imagery engages with ideas of restraint, compassion, and dignity. Mazur taught at Harvard and RISD and remains influential for his commitment to art as moral inquiry.
Among the works is a sculpture by Nancy Selvage—intricate steel forms that hover between machine and creature. As ceramics director at Harvard, Selvage blurred the line between craft and fine art, leaning into repetition, patience, and material innovation.
Together, these artists signal how New England has been more than a backdrop—it’s been a site of artistic ferment and ethical grappling.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by exiting this gallery through the far doorway, descending the ramp, and entering the room marked “Sculpture and Space.”
