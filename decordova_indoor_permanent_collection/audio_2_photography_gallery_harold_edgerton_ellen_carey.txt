Orientation:
At the top of the stairs, turn right into a light-filled room with neutral walls. On your left, you’ll see arresting scientific photographs; on your right, abstract photograms.

Narration:
On one wall are Harold Edgerton’s iconic stroboscopic images—bullets suspended in midair, milk droplets caught in a crown of symmetry, motion frozen in time. Edgerton was an MIT engineer who invented innovative photographic techniques to capture split-second phenomena. What began as scientific experimentation has since been recognized as art—images that are both precise and poetic.
Opposite, you'll find Ellen Carey’s photograms—cameraless photographs made by placing objects directly on photosensitive paper and exposing them to light. Bold colors, abstract shapes, experimental processes—these are works that champion chance and creativity. Carey’s vibrant compositions redefine what a photograph can be.
Together, these artists bookend the possibilities of photography—from scientific documentation to free associative abstraction. Culturally, they show how the medium can be both exact and emotive, technological and tactile.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by continuing into the next room where works by New England artists are grouped under the theme “New England Voices.”
