Orientation:
Enter the small, flexible gallery hosting the current “Emerging Voices” show.

Narration:
On one wall, Latoya Hobbs’ large-scale woodcuts depict Black women in moments of quiet power and connection. Hobbs, working in Boston, merges print tradition with Afrocentric aesthetics to redefine subjects and space.
Opposite, Alex Da Corte’s whimsical installations reassemble familiar objects—cereal boxes, neon signage—in absurd reconstructions. His work critiques mass culture while inviting delight and surprise.
This space is agile, dynamic, and full of potential. It’s a glimpse into where art is headed—from emerging artists who are regional, global, personal, strange, and necessary.

Transition:
Please resume the tour by exiting the gallery and returning to the main lobby. You’ve completed the Indoor Permanent Collection Tour.
