Orientation:
Step into a spacious, sunlit gallery. You’ll see Sol LeWitt’s wire-frame cube edifices in one corner and an architectural installation slicing across the room.

Narration:
LeWitt’s modular cube structures are deceptively simple. Made from painted wooden boards, these open frameworks embody his belief: the idea of a work is more important than its execution. LeWitt’s grids invite you to move around them, to see how perception shifts based on perspective.
Opposite, Sarah Oppenheimer’s sculptural intervention breaks the room’s geometry. A cut portal or folded wall redefines your flow through space, disorienting you just enough to notice the gallery architecture itself. Her work destabilizes. It asks: how can altering a wall change your understanding of the room—and your relationship to it?
This gallery shows that sculpture can be spatial thinking. It can shape how we move, think, and feel.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by turning left into the video art gallery.
