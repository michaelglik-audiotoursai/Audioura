Orientation:
On the ground floor, enter the gallery with large windows and an “industrial” ambiance. You’ll see sculptures made from everyday and recycled materials.

Narration:
Chakaia Booker’s sculpture, made of reclaimed tires, twists into a thorny, resilient form—suggestive of armor, hair, or organic growth. Booker’s work elevates discarded materials to bold cultural statements about identity, ecology, and resistance.
Nearby, Soo Sunny Park’s light installation refracts rainbows across the walls. A glass-wire form pulses color as you move through it—an ephemeral stained-glass effect built from modern industriousness.
Roberto Lugo’s ceramics combine classical vase forms with graffiti aesthetics. His pots feature images of George Washington coexisting with portraits of contemporary civil rights icons—speaking to historical lineage, power, and representation.
This gallery asks: what is worthy of a pedestal—and who gets to decide?

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by exiting into the hallway and entering the gallery titled “Emerging Voices.”
