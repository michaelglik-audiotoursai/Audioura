✅ Episode 2: "Baseball's Magic Mud" - Available for extraction
✅ Content Quality: Well above 100-byte minimum
✅ Rich Content: Titles, descriptions, timestamps, show info
✅ Browser Automation: 7,000+ characters of full text extracted

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

✅ Error Handling: Distinguishing between valid/invalid URLs

PRODUCTION READY:
- Browser automation successfully extracts Spotify episode content
- Content validation (100-byte minimum) working correctly

RECOMMENDATION:
✅ Deploy enhanced Spotify processor to production
