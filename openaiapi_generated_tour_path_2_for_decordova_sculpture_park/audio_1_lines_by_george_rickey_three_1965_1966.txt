Orientation: From the main entrance, head to 'Lines'. As you approach "Lines by George Rickey Three, 1965-1966," position yourself to the left of the sculpture, allowing the gentle breeze to set the kinetic elements in motion, creating an ever-changing interplay of lines and shadows.

George Rickey's "Lines Three" is a mesmerizing kinetic sculpture that embodies the essence of movement and balance. Comprised of three slender stainless steel rods delicately balanced on a central pivot, the sculpture seems to defy gravity as the rods gracefully sway and intersect with one another. The simplicity of the work belies its complex choreography, with each rod responding to the slightest shift in the surrounding environment.

Rickey, a pioneering American kinetic sculptor, was inspired by the dynamic interplay of form and space. His sculptures, like "Lines Three," explore the relationship between geometric shapes and motion, inviting viewers to contemplate the ever-changing patterns created by the interlocking lines. By incorporating movement into his work, Rickey challenged traditional notions of sculpture and invited viewers to engage with art in a new and dynamic way.

"Lines Three" exemplifies Rickey's mastery of balance and precision, with the carefully calibrated rods moving in perfect harmony. The sculpture's rhythmic dance against the backdrop of the park's natural beauty creates a mesmerizing visual experience that encourages contemplation and reflection. Visitors are invited to observe the interplay of light and shadow as the sculpture's form shifts and evolves throughout the day, offering a unique perspective with each passing moment.
