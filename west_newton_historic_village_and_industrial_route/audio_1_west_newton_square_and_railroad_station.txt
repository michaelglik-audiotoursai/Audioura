Orientation: Begin at the center of West Newton Square, standing near the intersection of Washington Street and Waltham Street. Face south toward the brick station building and the rail line beyond.

West Newton Square is one of the oldest and most historically cohesive commercial centers in the city. Its development closely tracks the growth of the Boston & Worcester Railroad, which arrived in 1834 and made West Newton one of the earliest suburban rail stops in America. The surviving station, a red-brick structure built in the 1880s, features modest Victorian Gothic elements, including pointed arches and decorative brickwork. In the 19th century, the station brought waves of city dwellers seeking the rural ideal, which led to the creation of nearby boarding houses, shops, and a proliferation of educational institutions. The station's surroundings still reflect that layered development, from early frame buildings to mid-20th-century storefronts. The square served not only as a transit hub but also as a civic meeting place, hosting parades, protests, and town announcements.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Head west along Washington Street for about 300 meters and turn left on Elm Street to reach the entrance of the Second Church in Newton.
