Orientation: Stand near the historical marker or modern buildings on the north side of Highland Avenue.

This temporary campus of the New England Hospital for Women and Children operated during periods of overflow and training in the late 19th century. It was among the first institutions in the nation where women could train and practice as doctors, midwives, and nurses. Though the buildings have changed, this location speaks to the shifting norms around gender, health, and professionalization. Newtonâ€™s willingness to host progressive institutions helped forge its identity as both a conservative suburb and a testing ground for social reform.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Head east on Highland Avenue and turn north on Washington Park to reach the final stop: the West Newton Branch Library.
