Orientation: Stand on Elm Street facing the grand entrance of the church with its bell tower and large stained-glass windows.

Founded in 1764 and relocated several times before settling in this location in the mid-19th century, Second Church in Newton represents both religious tradition and architectural evolution. The current building, completed in 1916, is a stunning example of Georgian Revival architecture. Its imposing columns, symmetrical brick facade, and lantern tower reflect a conservative, orderly aesthetic tied to New England religious values. The church has played a prominent role in Newton’s civic life: supporting abolition in the 19th century, hosting wartime support efforts, and promoting LGBTQ inclusion in the 21st. Inside, memorial stained-glass windows and finely crafted woodwork stand as testaments to the congregation’s long-term investment in both spiritual and artistic legacy.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Walk back toward Washington Street and proceed west about 400 meters to Cherry Street. Turn right to reach the Jackson Homestead.
