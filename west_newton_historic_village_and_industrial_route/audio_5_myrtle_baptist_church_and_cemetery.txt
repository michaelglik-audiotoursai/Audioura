Orientation: Stand at the front of the church on Curve Street, facing the red-brick structure with Gothic arched windows.

Founded by freed African Americans in the 1870s, Myrtle Baptist Church has stood for generations as a center of Black life in Newton. The current building, rebuilt after a fire in 1898, combines elements of Gothic Revival and vernacular New England church design. It features arched stained-glass windows, a steep gabled roof, and a modest bell tower. The church has served not only as a place of worship but also as a venue for civil rights organizing, music education, and community aid. Its adjacent cemetery includes some of Newtonâ€™s earliest African American residents. This site provides a powerful narrative of resilience, activism, and identity often missing from broader historical tours.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Walk north on Chestnut Street to Highland Avenue and continue east toward the Nathaniel Allen House.
