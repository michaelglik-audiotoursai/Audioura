Orientation: Stand at the front gate, facing the yellow clapboard house with a central doorway and evenly spaced windows.

The Jackson Homestead, built in 1809, is one of Newton’s most significant historic sites. This Federal-style home with its simple symmetry and understated elegance belonged to the Jackson family, prominent abolitionists and civic leaders. It was an active stop on the Underground Railroad, a fact highlighted in the house’s transformation into the Newton History Museum. The structure retains many original architectural features, including wide-plank floors and hand-carved mantels. Exhibits inside the museum explore Newton’s development, antislavery movements, and the industrialization of the 19th century. The site exemplifies how domestic spaces intersected with moral and political activism in antebellum America.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Return to Washington Street, walk west past West Newton Cinema, and turn right on River Street to reach the site of the former Newton Cotton Factory.
