Orientation: Stand at the historical marker near the Charles River footbridge, with the river flowing beside you.

The Newton Cotton Factory, established in 1813 along the Charles River, was among the earliest textile mills in the region. Though the building no longer stands, the site is marked and remembered as a critical node in Newton's industrial era. The factory utilized water power from the river and employed women and children in the early stages of America's industrial revolution. This location marks a turning point in West Newton's economy—from agriculture to mechanized labor. It also opens conversations about labor rights, environmental impact, and the changing role of women in the workforce. The adjacent Riverwalk trail and preserved green spaces speak to today’s emphasis on reclaiming industrial land for public use.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Head north along River Street, then turn left on Chestnut Street. Walk 500 meters to the historic Myrtle Baptist Church.
