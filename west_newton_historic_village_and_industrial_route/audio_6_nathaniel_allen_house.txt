Orientation: Stand on the lawn facing the Greek Revival house with its prominent front portico.

Built in the 1840s, this stately home belonged to Nathaniel Allen, an educational reformer and progressive thinker. The Greek Revival style—popular at the time—reflects the young republic’s admiration for classical democracy. Allen established a progressive co-educational academy here, one of the first in the country to admit both girls and boys as equals. He advocated anti-slavery, healthy living, and science-based instruction. The building, recently restored, now serves as a cultural venue and headquarters for Historic Newton. Its legacy highlights Newton's deep roots in progressive reform and education.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Walk northeast along Highland Avenue and cross Walnut Street to reach the former New England Hospital for Women and Children site.
