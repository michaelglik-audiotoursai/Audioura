   - Create a new spreadsheet
   - Name it "Openaiapi Generated Tour For Decordova Sculpture Park Usage Tracking"
   - Note the spreadsheet ID from the URL (the long string between /d/ and /edit)

2. Create a Google Apps Script:
   - In your spreadsheet, click Extensions > Apps Script
   - Delete any code in the editor
   - Copy and paste the code from the file: C:\Users\micha\eclipse-workspace\AudioTours\development\tour_tracking_script.gs
   - Replace the empty spreadsheetId with your spreadsheet ID
   - Save the project (name it "Audio Tour Tracking")
   - Click Deploy > New deployment
   - Select "Web app" as the type
   - Set "Who has access" to "Anyone"
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Copy the Web app URL

3. Update your HTML file:

   - Find the line with "https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec"
   - Replace it with your Web app URL
   - Save the file

4. Share your HTML file:
