echo Button Click Approach (Fixed):
echo - Finds and clicks actual play buttons near "Stop X" or "Audio X" text
echo - Navigation finds specific stop text and clicks associated play button
echo - Uses existing microphone permission (already in pubspec)
echo - Clicks buttons with play symbols (â–¶) or play text
echo.
echo Fixed duplicate permission_handler entry in pubspec.yaml
