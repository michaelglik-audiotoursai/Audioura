Step-by-Step Audio Guided Tour: West Newton Historic Village & Industrial Route

Stop 1: West Newton Square and Railroad Station
Orientation: Begin at the center of West Newton Square, standing near the intersection of Washington Street and Waltham Street. Face south toward the brick station building and the rail line beyond.

West Newton Square is one of the oldest and most historically cohesive commercial centers in the city. Its development closely tracks the growth of the Boston & Worcester Railroad, which arrived in 1834 and made West Newton one of the earliest suburban rail stops in America. The surviving station, a red-brick structure built in the 1880s, features modest Victorian Gothic elements, including pointed arches and decorative brickwork. In the 19th century, the station brought waves of city dwellers seeking the rural ideal, which led to the creation of nearby boarding houses, shops, and a proliferation of educational institutions. The station's surroundings still reflect that layered development, from early frame buildings to mid-20th-century storefronts. The square served not only as a transit hub but also as a civic meeting place, hosting parades, protests, and town announcements.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Head west along Washington Street for about 300 meters and turn left on Elm Street to reach the entrance of the Second Church in Newton.

Stop 2: Second Church in Newton
Orientation: Stand on Elm Street facing the grand entrance of the church with its bell tower and large stained-glass windows.

Founded in 1764 and relocated several times before settling in this location in the mid-19th century, Second Church in Newton represents both religious tradition and architectural evolution. The current building, completed in 1916, is a stunning example of Georgian Revival architecture. Its imposing columns, symmetrical brick facade, and lantern tower reflect a conservative, orderly aesthetic tied to New England religious values. The church has played a prominent role in Newton’s civic life: supporting abolition in the 19th century, hosting wartime support efforts, and promoting LGBTQ inclusion in the 21st. Inside, memorial stained-glass windows and finely crafted woodwork stand as testaments to the congregation’s long-term investment in both spiritual and artistic legacy.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Walk back toward Washington Street and proceed west about 400 meters to Cherry Street. Turn right to reach the Jackson Homestead.

Stop 3: Jackson Homestead and Museum
Orientation: Stand at the front gate, facing the yellow clapboard house with a central doorway and evenly spaced windows.

The Jackson Homestead, built in 1809, is one of Newton’s most significant historic sites. This Federal-style home with its simple symmetry and understated elegance belonged to the Jackson family, prominent abolitionists and civic leaders. It was an active stop on the Underground Railroad, a fact highlighted in the house’s transformation into the Newton History Museum. The structure retains many original architectural features, including wide-plank floors and hand-carved mantels. Exhibits inside the museum explore Newton’s development, antislavery movements, and the industrialization of the 19th century. The site exemplifies how domestic spaces intersected with moral and political activism in antebellum America.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Return to Washington Street, walk west past West Newton Cinema, and turn right on River Street to reach the site of the former Newton Cotton Factory.

Stop 4: Site of Newton Cotton Factory
Orientation: Stand at the historical marker near the Charles River footbridge, with the river flowing beside you.

The Newton Cotton Factory, established in 1813 along the Charles River, was among the earliest textile mills in the region. Though the building no longer stands, the site is marked and remembered as a critical node in Newton's industrial era. The factory utilized water power from the river and employed women and children in the early stages of America's industrial revolution. This location marks a turning point in West Newton's economy—from agriculture to mechanized labor. It also opens conversations about labor rights, environmental impact, and the changing role of women in the workforce. The adjacent Riverwalk trail and preserved green spaces speak to today’s emphasis on reclaiming industrial land for public use.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Head north along River Street, then turn left on Chestnut Street. Walk 500 meters to the historic Myrtle Baptist Church.

Stop 5: Myrtle Baptist Church and Cemetery
Orientation: Stand at the front of the church on Curve Street, facing the red-brick structure with Gothic arched windows.

Founded by freed African Americans in the 1870s, Myrtle Baptist Church has stood for generations as a center of Black life in Newton. The current building, rebuilt after a fire in 1898, combines elements of Gothic Revival and vernacular New England church design. It features arched stained-glass windows, a steep gabled roof, and a modest bell tower. The church has served not only as a place of worship but also as a venue for civil rights organizing, music education, and community aid. Its adjacent cemetery includes some of Newton’s earliest African American residents. This site provides a powerful narrative of resilience, activism, and identity often missing from broader historical tours.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Walk north on Chestnut Street to Highland Avenue and continue east toward the Nathaniel Allen House.

Stop 6: Nathaniel Allen House
Orientation: Stand on the lawn facing the Greek Revival house with its prominent front portico.

Built in the 1840s, this stately home belonged to Nathaniel Allen, an educational reformer and progressive thinker. The Greek Revival style—popular at the time—reflects the young republic’s admiration for classical democracy. Allen established a progressive co-educational academy here, one of the first in the country to admit both girls and boys as equals. He advocated anti-slavery, healthy living, and science-based instruction. The building, recently restored, now serves as a cultural venue and headquarters for Historic Newton. Its legacy highlights Newton's deep roots in progressive reform and education.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Walk northeast along Highland Avenue and cross Walnut Street to reach the former New England Hospital for Women and Children site.

Stop 7: Site of New England Hospital for Women and Children (Temporary Campus)
Orientation: Stand near the historical marker or modern buildings on the north side of Highland Avenue.

This temporary campus of the New England Hospital for Women and Children operated during periods of overflow and training in the late 19th century. It was among the first institutions in the nation where women could train and practice as doctors, midwives, and nurses. Though the buildings have changed, this location speaks to the shifting norms around gender, health, and professionalization. Newton’s willingness to host progressive institutions helped forge its identity as both a conservative suburb and a testing ground for social reform.

Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by following these directions: Head east on Highland Avenue and turn north on Washington Park to reach the final stop: the West Newton Branch Library.

Stop 8: West Newton Branch Library (Closed)
Orientation: Face the former library’s classical facade, with its pilasters and triangular pediment.

Though currently closed, the West Newton Branch Library remains a striking example of early 20th-century civic architecture. Built in 1927, it employed Classical Revival design to express the ideals of knowledge, permanence, and civic virtue. Pilasters flank the entrance, and the balanced facade echoes ancient temples, elevating the status of reading and learning to the sacred. The branch served generations of West Newton residents until its closure. Today, its potential repurposing represents ongoing questions of preservation, public investment, and community memory.
