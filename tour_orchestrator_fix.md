# Tour Orchestrator Service Fix Documentation

## Issue
The Docker container `tour-orchestrator-1` was failing with the error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'
```

## Root Cause
The `psycopg2` module was imported in the `tour_orchestrator_service.py` file but was not included in the `requirements-orchestrator.txt` file. The `restore_orchestrator.bat` script attempted to install `psycopg2-binary` in the Docker container, but the installation was failing.

## Solution
1. Added `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9` to the `requirements-orchestrator.txt` file
2. Rebuilt the Docker image with the updated requirements
3. Created a backup of the existing container's data
4. Removed the old container
5. Started a new container with the correct name (`tour-orchestrator-1`) and network (`development_default`)
6. Restored the backed up data to the new container

## Files Modified
- `requirements-orchestrator.txt`: Added `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9`
- `restore_orchestrator.bat`: Added `--no-cache-dir` flag to the pip install command

## New Files Created
- `fix_psycopg2.bat`: A script to install system dependencies and psycopg2-binary in the Docker container
- `rebuild_orchestrator.bat`: A script to rebuild the Docker container with the updated requirements

## Verification
The container is now running successfully with no errors. The `psycopg2` module is properly installed, and the service is running in debug mode.

## Future Recommendations
1. Always include all required dependencies in the requirements file
2. Consider using a multi-stage Docker build to install system dependencies and then copy only the necessary files to the final image
3. Add health checks to the Docker container to detect and recover from failures
4. Implement proper error handling in the application to gracefully handle missing dependencies
