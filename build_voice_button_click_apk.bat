echo Button Click Approach:
echo - Finds and clicks actual play buttons near "Stop X" or "Audio X" text
echo - Navigation finds specific stop text and clicks associated play button
echo - Added microphone permission check and request
echo - Clicks buttons with play symbols (â–¶) or play text
echo.
echo This should actually click the HTML play buttons instead of trying to play audio directly
