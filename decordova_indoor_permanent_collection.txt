Step-by-Step Audio Guided Tour: Indoor Permanent Collection

Stop 1: Museum Entrance & Orientation

Orientation:
Stand just inside the front doors on Sandy Pond Road in the grand entry hall. Ahead of you is a broad terrazzo stairway that leads up to the galleries—the threshold between old mansion and modern museum.

Narration:
Welcome to the deCordova Museum. This entry hall, redesigned in 1998 by Kallmann McKinnell & Wood, is a beautiful blend of past and present. Beneath your feet, you’ll notice the terrazzo flooring—a smooth, polished surface that transitions seamlessly from the old to the new. Above, skylights pull daylight deep into the building, lighting your path upward.
Originally Julian de Cordova’s private estate, these spaces have been transformed into something public, democratic, and forward-looking. That transformation is literal in the architecture—and metaphorical in the deCordova mission: honoring history while making bold space for contemporary creativity.
Today, you’re stepping into a museum that cares about legacy—but also about what happens next. Notice how the older masonry meets sleek steel handrails. The mood is welcoming, contemplative, and energetic.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by ascending the central stairs and turning right into the first permanent galleries.

Stop 2: Photography Gallery – Harold Edgerton & Ellen Carey

Orientation:
At the top of the stairs, turn right into a light-filled room with neutral walls. On your left, you’ll see arresting scientific photographs; on your right, abstract photograms.

Narration:
On one wall are Harold Edgerton’s iconic stroboscopic images—bullets suspended in midair, milk droplets caught in a crown of symmetry, motion frozen in time. Edgerton was an MIT engineer who invented innovative photographic techniques to capture split-second phenomena. What began as scientific experimentation has since been recognized as art—images that are both precise and poetic.
Opposite, you'll find Ellen Carey’s photograms—cameraless photographs made by placing objects directly on photosensitive paper and exposing them to light. Bold colors, abstract shapes, experimental processes—these are works that champion chance and creativity. Carey’s vibrant compositions redefine what a photograph can be.
Together, these artists bookend the possibilities of photography—from scientific documentation to free associative abstraction. Culturally, they show how the medium can be both exact and emotive, technological and tactile.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by continuing into the next room where works by New England artists are grouped under the theme “New England Voices.”

Stop 3: New England Voices – Dehner, Mazur, Selvage

Orientation:
Proceed into the adjoining gallery. The walls display a mix of paintings and sculpture by artists rooted in the New England region.

Narration:
This gallery is an exploration of place, identity, and creative transformation in the region. Dorothy Dehner’s White Shadow uses bold abstract forms that evoke urban landscapes and psychological tension—she transitioned from figurative to abstract in the 1950s and emerged as a voice of American Modernism.
Nearby, Michael Mazur’s expressive prints confront moral and social themes—his prison imagery engages with ideas of restraint, compassion, and dignity. Mazur taught at Harvard and RISD and remains influential for his commitment to art as moral inquiry.
Among the works is a sculpture by Nancy Selvage—intricate steel forms that hover between machine and creature. As ceramics director at Harvard, Selvage blurred the line between craft and fine art, leaning into repetition, patience, and material innovation.
Together, these artists signal how New England has been more than a backdrop—it’s been a site of artistic ferment and ethical grappling.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by exiting this gallery through the far doorway, descending the ramp, and entering the room marked “Sculpture and Space.”

Stop 4: Sculpture and Space – LeWitt & Oppenheimer

Orientation:
Step into a spacious, sunlit gallery. You’ll see Sol LeWitt’s wire-frame cube edifices in one corner and an architectural installation slicing across the room.

Narration:
LeWitt’s modular cube structures are deceptively simple. Made from painted wooden boards, these open frameworks embody his belief: the idea of a work is more important than its execution. LeWitt’s grids invite you to move around them, to see how perception shifts based on perspective.
Opposite, Sarah Oppenheimer’s sculptural intervention breaks the room’s geometry. A cut portal or folded wall redefines your flow through space, disorienting you just enough to notice the gallery architecture itself. Her work destabilizes. It asks: how can altering a wall change your understanding of the room—and your relationship to it?
This gallery shows that sculpture can be spatial thinking. It can shape how we move, think, and feel.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by turning left into the video art gallery.

Stop 5: Video Art & New Media – Oursler & Lucier

Orientation:
Enter a dimmed room with two screens and low ambient sound. A projected face floats ahead; a multi-screen installation shimmers to your right.

Narration:
Tony Oursler’s installation features a projected, disembodied face emerging from a soft form—splicing voice and vision into an eerie, intimate performance. Oursler explores how media shapes identity, memory, and myth.
Mary Lucier’s multi-screen piece loops footage of landscapes, tide pools, or crumbling ruins—sped up, slowed down, re-textured. Her work feels like a living painting—poetic and environmental. Lucier’s pioneering approach to video lets time breathe, to pulse, and to fade.
This room is less about looking, more about feeling. Video art invites you to sit, close your eyes, listen, and see inside yourself.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by exiting this room and taking the stairs back to the rooftop gallery.

Stop 6: Rooftop Gallery – Takenaga, Phillips, Agha

Orientation:
Ascend one level to the rooftop. You’ll enter a bright space with panoramic windows framing Flint’s Pond and the sculpture park beyond.

Narration:
Barbara Takenaga’s cosmic painting is a swirl of dots, spirals, and shimmering color—evoking galaxies or microscopic life. A New England-based artist, Takenaga crosses boundaries between science, spirituality, and abstraction.
Roger Phillips’ wood relief feels alive—the grain almost moves, shining like waves when light passes over it. Phillips, trained as an architect, brings biomorphic design and attention to sustainable woods.
Anila Quayyum Agha’s laser-cut wood panels float nearby, casting intricate shadows like mandalas across the floor. Agha merges Islamic geometry with patterns of light, offering quiet meditation and cultural fusion.
Here, art meets nature. Sky, water, light, and form embraced through diverse mediums.

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by descending to the ground floor and entering the “Material Transformations” gallery to your left.

Stop 7: Material Transformations – Booker, Park, Lugo

Orientation:
On the ground floor, enter the gallery with large windows and an “industrial” ambiance. You’ll see sculptures made from everyday and recycled materials.

Narration:
Chakaia Booker’s sculpture, made of reclaimed tires, twists into a thorny, resilient form—suggestive of armor, hair, or organic growth. Booker’s work elevates discarded materials to bold cultural statements about identity, ecology, and resistance.
Nearby, Soo Sunny Park’s light installation refracts rainbows across the walls. A glass-wire form pulses color as you move through it—an ephemeral stained-glass effect built from modern industriousness.
Roberto Lugo’s ceramics combine classical vase forms with graffiti aesthetics. His pots feature images of George Washington coexisting with portraits of contemporary civil rights icons—speaking to historical lineage, power, and representation.
This gallery asks: what is worthy of a pedestal—and who gets to decide?

Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by exiting into the hallway and entering the gallery titled “Emerging Voices.”

Stop 8: Emerging Voices – Hobbs & Da Corte

Orientation:
Enter the small, flexible gallery hosting the current “Emerging Voices” show.

Narration:
On one wall, Latoya Hobbs’ large-scale woodcuts depict Black women in moments of quiet power and connection. Hobbs, working in Boston, merges print tradition with Afrocentric aesthetics to redefine subjects and space.
Opposite, Alex Da Corte’s whimsical installations reassemble familiar objects—cereal boxes, neon signage—in absurd reconstructions. His work critiques mass culture while inviting delight and surprise.
This space is agile, dynamic, and full of potential. It’s a glimpse into where art is headed—from emerging artists who are regional, global, personal, strange, and necessary.

Transition:
Please resume the tour by exiting the gallery and returning to the main lobby. You’ve completed the Indoor Permanent Collection Tour.
