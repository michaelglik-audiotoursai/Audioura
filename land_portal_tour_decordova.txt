Step-by-Step Audio Guided Tour: Land Portal Tour
By Ellie Irons and Aubrie James – deCordova Sculpture Park

Stop 1: Living Crystals and the Great Acceleration (Dawn Redwood Tree)
Orientation:
Start at the entry sign near the deCordova main entrance. Walk slightly downslope until you reach the tall, soft-needled dawn redwood tree beside the path.
Narration:
This dawn redwood is a particularly beautiful example of what some might call a “living crystal.” In geology, crystals are defined as inorganic (non-living) materials that have a certain molecular structure. Like nearly all plants on Earth, this tree combines crystals with starlight, air, and water (nupee) to build the sugars and starches that make up its leaves, bark, roots, and trunk. Despite its slow nature, standing next to the dawn redwood, you are in the presence of a strange, lively, and ongoing performance.


The presence of this plant also gives us special clues about deCordova’s ecosystem. This species is a “living fossil” not native to Massachusetts. Originating from China, it was thought to be extinct until it was discovered by Chinese botanists in the 1940s. Scientists from Harvard University took interest and brought the dawn redwood to the United States. Now, this species is planted as an ornamental tree (muhtuq) all over the world.

Such rapid, intercontinental species exchange is a hallmark of what is sometimes called the great acceleration, or the increase in human activity since the mid-20th century and its effects on planetary systems. As you will see at deCordova, ecosystems in the time of the great acceleration are quite distinct from ecosystems in the past.

To open the first part of the portal, do these in order:

gently touch the bark of the tree. Try to sense exactly where light from the sun—a star (anaquhs)—reaches your skin. Seek out and touch a nearby rock. Notice your breath in and out. Reach down and feel the moist grass or soil. Sun, stone, breath, water—these are the raw ingredients that plants use to grow and live.
This dawn redwood isn’t just ornamental—it’s a time-traveling witness. Once thought extinct, it was rediscovered in China in the 1940s and brought to the U.S. by Harvard botanists. As a “living fossil,” it symbolizes both prehistoric persistence and modern ecological disruption.
The artists call it a “living crystal,” channeling sunlight, minerals, and water to build its tissues. This tree reflects the age of the Great Acceleration—the modern surge in global interconnection and ecological change since the mid-20th century. Trees like this move water through their trunks and air through their leaves—quietly altering our atmosphere. In touching its bark and the stone beside it, you’re entering the world of slow, living time.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by continuing forward to the grove of evergreens and locate the visible water spigot on your right.

Stop 2: Water Bodies and Pumps (Water Infrastructure and the Body)
Orientation:
Stand with your back to the dawn redwood and face the water spigot nestled within a grove of evergreens.
Narration:
he dawn redwood we just met moves water through their tree-body, drawing it up from the soil to support and energize their cells, before sending it out into the air (i.e. transpiration). Our human bodies also hold, circulate, and transmit water.


To keep water (nupee) close at hand, humans engineer complex systems for storing and moving it around. From the dawn redwood, walk further into campus towards a tall grove of evergreen trees. There you will find a water spigot that is a portal to one such system. Stand with your back to the dawn redwood, facing the spigot. Just downhill to your left, out of sight behind the trees, sits the town’s drinking water treatment plant. Here water is filtered, treated, and made safer for humans to consume before being pushed into a series of subterranean pipes. The main waterline (a 12” wide pipe) is buried under the road you drove on to get here. A smaller 8” wide pipe comes off that main line, then increasingly fine branches bring water to this spigot and further into deCordova, where it splashes into sinks and flushes toilets in the store, studios, and museum. To get to the offices on the top floor of the museum, water needs to be pumped hundreds of feet above the treatment plant. Gravity pulls “wastewater” from the museum back down through drains and pipes into a large holding tank. Solids settle out in the tank for later removal, while water is released into a leach field beneath the parking lot filter further downward into the soil.

Bring your fingers to your neck, touching lightly just below your jawbone. Feel for your pulse. If you’re comfortable doing so, close your eyes and connect with the liquid pumping through your body. Your body is at least half water- and the blood in your veins is mostly water.
Just as trees pump water from soil to sky, so do humans engineer their own systems for water movement. The spigot here connects to a hidden infrastructure: water drawn from Lincoln’s nearby treatment plant, pumped uphill through pipes, then distributed to sinks, studios, and restrooms across deCordova.
You are water, too—over half of your body. Touch your neck and feel your pulse: your own personal plumbing system. In this stop, Ellie Irons and Aubrie James ask us to recognize the poetry and politics of water circulation—across tree, body, and institution.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by walking across the South Lawn. Make your way to the tree line and find the hidden trail leading down to a stone barn foundation.

Stop 3: Ghost Forest and Ghost Barn (Vanished Trees and Stone Remains)
Orientation:
Enter the South Lawn and walk its length to find a narrow trail. Follow it downhill to the remnants of a stone barn foundation in the forest.
Narration:
With the map as your guide, make your way to and across the South Lawn. This elongated clearing is carefully constructed to create a deep line of sight. More than four hundred years ago, this land was densely forested, and tree giants stood here, obstructing the view. Can you see or feel their ghosts? At the far edge of the lawn, find the hidden trail and follow it to the lowest point on our walk: the sunken foundation of what used to be a barn.


By the mid-1800s, up to 80% of these mature forests (tawahkamuq) were gone, cleared by settlers to create agricultural fields. Today most of those fields have fallen out of use. Forests have returned to much of the land, but they are not the ancient, robust forests nurtured by Indigenous people including the Wampanoag before colonization. Rather, they are middle-aged forests, a mixture of migrant and native trees living together in a changing climate.


As you consider what it’s like to be a middle-aged tree in an ever-changing patch of forest, notice the stone structure that surrounds you. Stones are omnipresent here at deCordova. The soil is riddled with them. The freeze / thaw cycle pushes these stones to the surface, birthing them onto the land where they present themselves as material for human infrastructure projects. At the same time early settlers were felling the trees who used to stand here, they were also hauling stones. They built barns, houses, and the myriad rock walls that crisscross the land. They divided the land into pasture and field, privatizing and commodifying these spaces for production. Now the stone structures linger, their utility outlived, providing a surface for lichens and moss, who contribute to their gradual decay.

Stand in the center of the barn foundation, and scan along the edges of the foundation at eye level. When something catches your eye, move closer for a careful look.

Look for :
false stones, true stones, & stones embraced by plants
stones split by weather, stones with layers & stones that sparkle in the sun
Imagine the labor that lifted and placed these stones, and the forces that will undo them.

This sunken rectangle of stone marks the footprint of a long-gone barn. Before settlers cleared this land for agriculture, towering forests once stood here. That landscape was erased—but its ghosts remain in the trees returning to this place. What you see now is a “middle-aged forest,” not the old-growth nurtured by Indigenous stewards like the Wampanoag. 
The barn’s stones, dug from the soil and stacked by settlers, reflect the conversion of land into labor. Lichens and mosses now soften their edges, but the story they tell—of extraction, division, and the privatizing of place—still echoes through the earth.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by continuing along the path up and over the wooded hill until you reach a bench beside a wide earthen basin.

Stop 4: Old Amphitheater Becomes Earth and Water Bowl
Orientation:
Exit the barn foundation from the opposite corner. Follow the conservation path up and over the wooded hillside until you find a bench overlooking a wide depression in the earth.
Narration:
Exit the barn foundation from the opposite corner of where you entered. Walk along the conservation land path along the perimeter of deCordova’s property up and over the wooded hillside, where you will find a bench.
Take a seat on the bench. Let yourself settle. Remember your pulse and the liquids circulating in your body. Sink into the bench, feel the tug of gravity, and try to connect to the liquid world inside you.
Now shift your attention to the land around you. In front of you sits a large bowl carved into the earth (ahkee). This used to be an amphitheater, but now has another life as a “detention basin”. It collects and holds water (nupee) so it can be released gradually. During heavy rain (s8kunôn) events (which are increasingly likely with climate change) water runs over the surface of the land, collecting wherever it can come to rest. The water that collects here comes from the east side of deCordova’s campus, draining off of hard surfaces like roads, buildings, and parking lots.
After water settles in the basin, it gradually moves on to other destinations: some water evaporates into the air, some is transferred to the wetlands below the parking lot, and some of it sinks down into the soil right here, trickling into an underground network of water held in gaps in soil and rocks. This underground water network is known as groundwater. About 30 percent of all readily available freshwater on the planet (mutâahk) is groundwater.

Find your way to the edge of the basin in front of the bench. Move along its border, looking down at the plants growing below. How many shapes and textures can you see? These plants help trap pollutants, preventing them from entering the groundwater supply. Thank the plants for acting as filter and protector of our groundwater, adapting themselves to thrive in this human-made water system. Moisture-loving plants you might see in the basin include sensitive fern, cattail, sedge, and white vervain.

This bowl-shaped basin used to be an amphitheater. Today, it holds water runoff during storms—an engineered “detention basin” designed for climate resilience. It collects water from paved surfaces like parking lots and roofs, allowing it to soak back into the soil or flow into surrounding wetlands. 
As you sit, reflect on the network of flows around and within you—your pulse, the trickle of groundwater, the pull of gravity. Water always moves. Plants here like cattails and sedges help filter pollutants before they reach the groundwater below.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by walking across the upland meadow and finding the large white oak tree facing the reservoir.

Stop 5: Grandpa Oak and the Soil Skeleton
Orientation:
In the sunny upland meadow, locate the large white oak tree near the top of the hill overlooking the reservoir.
Narration:
As you meander into your walk through the open and sunny upland meadow, try to spot slivers of the pond (nupuhsupâq) through the woods (tawahkamuq). Is the water sparkling with sunlight? Is it reflecting what is in the sky (keesuq), like a mirror?
In contrast to the low, bowl-shaped detention basin, the slope you stand on now is steep; rainwater doesn’t necessarily have time to percolate into the soil. Instead, it races down the hill into the reservoir below. This leads to erosion - the wearing away of the soil on the slope - which both re-shapes the land and brings soil particles to the water down below.
In addition to being pollinator-friendly and a nice nesting place for the resident snapping turtles, the plants in the oak-dotted meadow you are walking through were planted as erosion buffers. The roots of the plants in this meadow stabilize the soil, acting like a great underground skeleton holding the soil in place. This skeleton protects the pond, which is the main source of drinking water for Lincoln, Massachusetts.
White oaks like this one (Quercus alba) are native to Massachusetts and are the most common tree species at deCordova. Big oaks have silently presided over many of the changes to the landscape—from forest, to lawn, to meadow—stabilizing the ground they grow in, that in turn stabilizes and nourishes them.

Place one hand on the oak and face the reservoir, planting yourself in place. Imagine yourself as a branch of this old oak, growing strong and tall over the last 200 years. As you slowly stretch your other arm out and let it sway in the wind, imagine what sorts of changes you have witnessed through your life, standing and growing here over the last two centuries. What plants, animals (awâahsak), and people have passed under your leafy canopy?

This venerable white oak is more than a tree—it’s a soil stabilizer, a habitat anchor, and a witness to centuries of landscape change. The roots of meadow plants and oaks like this one form an underground skeleton, holding the soil in place and protecting the water supply below. 
This slope drains directly into the pond, Lincoln’s drinking source. Without plant roots, soil would erode downhill. The oak watches over all of it—forest, lawn, meadow—quietly reinforcing the balance between ground and growth, between history and habitat.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by walking to the isolated boulder near the ridge crest ahead of you.

Stop 6: Glacier Dance
Orientation:
Approach the large solitary boulder perched just below the rocky ridge trail.
Narration:
Whereas water in liquid form can change mountains through the slow, steady act of erosion, water in ice form can rearrange the landscape in another way. Twenty thousand years ago, a miles-high glacial ice sheet had steadily grown down from the Arctic to completely cover New England. As it grew, the ice indiscriminately collected everything from bacteria to boulders as big as houses, slowly scraping along, carving new landscape forms in its wake.

This boulder is a bit of a mystery on deCordova’s landscape. It could be a boulder that was taken for a ride by a glacier, or it could have simply been plucked from—or might even be a part of—the nearby rock ridge. The way to tell the difference is to compare this boulder to the jagged bedrock poking out of the ground, which you’ll see in more detail at the next stop. Are they the same, or different? If they are different, then maybe this boulder travelled far and wide in a glacier before arriving here at deCordova. If they’re the same, maybe the glacier just revealed this rock as it scraped along the surface of the earth.
Some say that this boulder marks where the founder of the museum, Julian de Cordova, is buried. If that’s true, maybe the stone was brought to this spot with the help of human-made machinery!
Try to move this large boulder.
Make a sound like a glacier scraping across the landscape. Now, do a movement like a glacier scraping across a landscape. This is the glacier song and dance.

Is this boulder native to this spot, or a glacial traveler? Glaciers once blanketed this region in ice a mile thick. As they crept across the land, they carved valleys, moved boulders, and revealed new surfaces. 
Some say museum founder Julian de Cordova is buried here—whether true or not, the stone’s mystery deepens our sense of time. Try the “glacier dance”: push the boulder (you won’t budge it), then scrape, grind, or move like ancient ice reshaping the land.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next stop once you reach it by climbing the stone steps ahead to the exposed rocky ridge known as Alice’s Garden.

Stop 7: You Were the Center of a Mountain
Orientation:
Climb the stone steps up to the rocky ridge. Stand with your hand on the largest exposed slab of bedrock—this is Alice’s Garden.
Narration:
Walk up the steps of this rocky ridge to find the next portal activation point:
This particular piece of bedrock is already an open portal. If you close your eyes and hold your hand on this rock, you should be able to connect to the time when it was formed, about 430 millions years ago.

Suddenly, your body is under immense pressure. You are growing warmer and warmer, now sweating, now boiling up, now melting, as you are surrounded by, and become, liquid heat. Looking up, you see only darkness. You are under a mountain—thousands of feet of pure rock —but the material directly around you is hot and liquified. Magma.

Slowly, over millions of years, you begin to cool, transforming. You come to rest in the very core of the mountain, but the surface of the mountain far above is subject to the power of water and wind. It slowly erodes. As time passes, you think you hear the faint whistling of the wind and—is that the vibration of raindrops reverberating through the mountain?

As time passes, you age into an old, old, old earth ancestor—hundreds of millions of years old. The mountain shield protecting you has eroded into a gently sloping landscape. Still, you remain tucked inside—in the core, in the dark.

Only a few years ago, a glacier grew, and grew, and grew. As it moved, it scraped across the surface of what was left of your old, protective mountaintop, removing it in some places completely. All of a sudden, you could feel the wind on your surface, and the cold rain (s8kunôn) as it hit your rocky skin. Eventually, you began to feel the peculiar sensation of mosses and lichens growing in the cracks of your stony exterior.

In what seems like just yesterday, you came to be called Alice’s Garden by the current inhabitants (wâtahkeecheek) of the surface. But your real name is much older, and stranger—and can only be pronounced by the landscape, over millions of years.

You're touching something 430 million years old. This bedrock was once at the heart of a massive mountain, formed under intense heat and pressure. Over eons, wind, rain, and glacier slowly stripped away the mountain, revealing the rock where you now stand. 
Close your eyes and imagine the magma, the darkness, the mountain shielding you. Now feel the moss, the breeze, the lichens—this is time, exposed. The artists invite you to become the rock, to remember what it is to be very old.
Transition:
Please resume the tour at the next and final stop once you reach it by stepping forward onto the flat terrace space near the highest point of the campus.

Stop 8: Becoming the Portal
Orientation:
Step onto the wide, open terrace at the summit of deCordova’s landscape. Face the sky and let the space expand around you.
Narration:
Please be aware, the Sculpture Terrace is occassionally closed during park hours for private events. Please check with any museum staff member for more details on access during your visit.

Leaving bedrock behind, enter this final stop with your face raised to the sky. Contemplate the beings you’ve met on this walk. The trees and grasses, the lichens and mosses, the boulders, stones and pebbles—they are all combinations of air, crystals, starlight, and water (nupee). So are you!

Imagine the strength of the sun beaming down on your skin, energizing your body. This warmth is followed by a gathering wind that portends a storm. Storm clouds roll in, and drama unfolds through your little window to the sky. Soon a crack of thunder (patahqahan), a flash of lightning (ukuchâmun), and the first rain (s8kunôn) drops begin to splatter across your cheeks, nose, and forehead. As those drops trickle across your skin, other drops hit the top branches of the dawn redwood and the white oak, and begin to stream downward on twigs and branches. Other droplets splatter on rock, bare soil, lawn, meadow. You stand on the highest land on the deCordova campus. As the storm builds, water begins to puddle, pool, and flow around your feet. Gravity pulls the water from high to low. Where the ground is porous and open, some water percolates right into the ground, working its way downward towards bedrock. Where the ground is hard and flat, it gathers in puddles that eventually overflow and rush downward towards the pond on one side and the detention basin on the other. Some of this water is absorbed to support the living-crystal bodies of plants, some will get pumped into the pipes that supply water for our drinking and bathing, and some will rise back into the air, enlivening the atmosphere.

Walk in a spiral along the edge of this wide, flat surface—a human-made plateau. Pause in the center, and orient yourself. Take a deep breath in, and let your lungs, chest, and belly swell. Then let the air out with a big “WOOOSH”. Next, raise this booklet over your head and use the hole in this page to frame the sky (keesuq). Let the paper block out the rest of the world, and focus your gaze. Breathe.

This is where it all converges—air, water, stone, time, and you. You are standing at the high point of the park, and from here, water will eventually flow in all directions: into soil, into pipes, into bodies—into the world. 
You, too, are made of starlight, minerals, air, and water. You are not simply on the land. You are the land—alive, breathing, transforming. This final stop invites you to center yourself, breathe deeply, and feel the storm gathering in your veins, your breath, and the sky.
Transition (Closing):
This concludes your Land Portal journey. Feel free to revisit any stop or reflect on your own pathways as you return to the museum or explore other sculptures. You have not just walked across the land—you have traveled through time and being, becoming the portal yourself.
