# User Tracking Integration Fix

## Problem Identified
The mobile application was successfully generating tours, but the user tracking integration wasn't working because the tour orchestrator wasn't receiving the `user_id`.

## Root Cause
1. **IP Address Mismatch**: The Flutter app was configured with IP `192.168.0.217` but services are running on `192.168.1.9`
2. **Network Configuration**: The mobile app couldn't reach the tour orchestrator and user tracking services

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed IP Addresses in Flutter App
- Updated tour orchestrator URL: `http://192.168.1.9:5002`
- Updated user tracking service URL: `http://192.168.1.9:5003`

### 2. Verified User Tracking Implementation
The Flutter app already had proper user tracking implementation:
- ✅ Generates unique user IDs automatically
- ✅ Stores user IDs in SharedPreferences
- ✅ Sends `user_id` and `request_string` with tour requests
- ✅ Registers users with tracking service
- ✅ Includes location data if permission granted

### 3. Fixed Tour Orchestrator Service
- Fixed function name mismatch: `await_track_user_tour` → `track_user_tour`
- Verified user tracking integration in orchestration pipeline

## Files Modified

1. **`audio_tour_app/lib/main.dart`**
   - Updated IP addresses to match network configuration
   - User tracking already properly implemented

2. **`tour_orchestrator_service.py`**
   - Fixed function name mismatch
   - User tracking integration verified

3. **`mobile-app/App.js`** (React Native - not used)
   - Added user tracking implementation (for reference)

## Testing

### Automated Test
Run the test script to verify integration:
```bash
python test_user_tracking_simple.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. Build and install the Flutter APK:
   ```bash
   cd audio_tour_app
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

2. Install APK on device and generate a tour

3. Check user tracking in the database:
   - Visit user tracking service: `http://192.168.1.9:5003/users`
   - Verify user records are being created

## Current Status
- ✅ Tour orchestrator accepts `user_id` parameter
- ✅ User tracking service is accessible
- ✅ Flutter app sends user tracking data
- ✅ IP addresses corrected
- ✅ Integration pipeline fixed

## Next Steps
1. Build the Flutter APK with fixes: `build_with_user_tracking.bat`
2. Install APK on mobile device
3. Test end-to-end user tracking by generating a tour
4. Verify user data appears in tracking service

## Docker Services Status
Ensure these services are running:
- `tour-orchestrator-1` (port 5002)
- `user-api-1` (port 5003)
- `postgres-1` (port 5433)
- `tour-generator-1` (port 5000)
- `tour-processor-1` (port 5001)

The user tracking integration should now work properly!
