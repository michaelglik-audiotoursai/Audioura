# Tour Orchestrator Service Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed
1. Missing `psycopg2` module in the Docker container
2. Container running with incorrect name
3. Container not connected to the development network

## Steps Taken
1. Added `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9` to `requirements-orchestrator.txt`
2. Rebuilt the Docker image with updated requirements
3. Created a backup of the existing container's data
4. Stopped and removed the incorrectly named container
5. Created a new container with:
   - Correct name: `development-tour-orchestrator-1` (matching other services)
   - Correct network: `development_default`
6. Restored the backed up data to the new container
7. Updated all scripts to use the correct container name

## Verification
- Container is running with the correct name
- Container is connected to the development network
- Health endpoint returns "healthy" status
- No more `ModuleNotFoundError` for `psycopg2`

## Updated Scripts
- `restore_orchestrator.bat`
- `fix_psycopg2.bat`
- `rebuild_orchestrator.bat`

## New Scripts
- `check_orchestrator_health.bat` - Verifies the container is running correctly

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the container for any further issues
2. Consider adding these dependencies to the Dockerfile directly
3. Update documentation to reflect the correct container name and network
