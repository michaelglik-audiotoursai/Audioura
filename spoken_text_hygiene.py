"""spoken_text_hygiene.py — D523: the last pass before a human hears it.

Two defects that survived every gate because no gate was looking at the assembled
text as SOUND rather than as claims.

**1. Template seams.** `"At this work: Le Lézard aux plumes d'or, witness Miró's
surreal exploration…"` — spoken aloud that is "at this work colon". The prompt
asks for "<fact> at <stop name>" and the model answers with a label. A strip for
exactly this already existed at `generate_tour_text.py:15498` but was applied only
to Part 4, and the 12:23 tour put it in the stop-1 ORIENTATION, which comes from a
different generator. So the strip moves here, where it sees the finished tour and
cannot be routed around.

**2. A full stop with no space after it.** `"…mythic creature.Published by Louis
Broder…"`, `"…printed works.This exhibition…"`, `"…depth.Boris Fridman…"`. Five
sightings in six runs — LEAD reported it as a "known defect" three times without
fixing it, on the grounds that it was upstream. It is upstream, and it is also two
lines to repair here, and a listener hears a word that does not exist.

Both are applied to the assembled tour, after every gate has had its say, so
nothing downstream can reintroduce them.
