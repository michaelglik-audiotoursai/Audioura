📱 Mobile Features:
✅ Native iOS & Android Support
File System Access - Downloads and stores tours locally

Offline Playback - Works without internet after download

Native WebView - Embedded tour player

Local Storage - Persistent tour library

✅ Platform Detection
Mobile: Auto-downloads, extracts, and stores locally

Web: Shows download options (fallback)

Cross-Platform: Same codebase, different behaviors

✅ Mobile-Specific Benefits
Background Downloads - Tours download in background

Offline Access - No internet needed after download

Native Performance - Smooth mobile experience

File Management - Automatic ZIP extraction and cleanup

🎯 How It Works on Mobile:
Generate Tour → Downloads ZIP to phone storage

Auto-Extract → Unzips files to app directory

Local Storage → Saves tour info persistently

Native Playback → WebView displays tour with audio

Offline Ready → Works without internet connection

📲 To Test on Your Phone:
# Connect Android phone via USB
flutter devices
flutter run

# Or build APK and install
flutter build apk
# Install the APK from build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

Copy
bash
The app will work perfectly on modern iPhones and Android phones with full native functionality! 🎉

I do not have iOS device or Mac device with me so we will concentrate on Android. Please explain in details, how do I pass APK into my phone?

Perfect! Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to build and install the APK on your Android phone:

📱 Step-by-Step Android APK Installation
Step 1: Build the APK
# Navigate to your Flutter app
cd c:\Users\micha\eclipse-workspace\AudioTours\development\audio_tour_app

# Update to mobile version
copy ..\pubspec_minimal.yaml pubspec.yaml
copy ..\main_dart_mobile_native.dart lib\main.dart
flutter pub get

# Build APK for Android
flutter build apk --release

Copy
bash
Step 2: Locate the APK File
After building, the APK will be at:

c:\Users\micha\eclipse-workspace\AudioTours\development\audio_tour_app\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk

Copy
Step 3: Transfer APK to Phone
Option A: USB Cable (Recommended)

Connect your Android phone to computer via USB

Enable File Transfer mode on phone (not just charging)

Copy APK to phone's Downloads folder:

# Copy APK to phone (when connected via USB)
copy build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk "D:\Download\"

Copy
bash
(Replace D: with your phone's drive letter)

Option B: Email/Cloud

Email the APK to yourself

Download on phone from email

Or upload to Google Drive/Dropbox and download on phone

Option C: Web Server

Start web server in APK directory:

cd build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\
python -m http.server 8080

Copy
bash
On phone browser : Go to http://192.168.0.217:8080

Download app-release.apk

Step 4: Enable Unknown Sources on Android
Android 8.0+ (Most Modern Phones):

Settings → Apps & notifications → Special app access

Install unknown apps

Select your browser/file manager

Toggle ON "Allow from this source"

Older Android:

Settings → Security

Toggle ON "Unknown sources"

Step 5: Install the APK
Open file manager on phone

Navigate to Downloads folder

Tap app-release.apk

Tap Install when prompted

Tap Open when installation completes

Step 6: Configure Network Access
Since your app connects to http://192.168.0.217:5002, make sure:

Phone and computer are on same WiFi network

Services are running :

docker-compose -f docker-compose-complete.yml up -d

Copy
bash
Test connection from phone browser:

Go to: http://192.168.0.217:5002/health

Should show: {"status":"healthy",...}

🎯 Quick Build Script:

🚀 Easy Build Command:
# Run the build script

Copy
bash
📋 Troubleshooting:
If APK won't install:

Check "Install unknown apps" is enabled

Try installing from different file manager

Restart phone and try again

If app can't connect:

Verify both devices on same WiFi

Test http://192.168.0.217:5002/health in phone browser

Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking port 5002

If build fails:

Run flutter doctor to check setup

Try flutter clean then rebuild

The APK will be about 20-50MB and will install as "Audio Tour Generator" on your Android phone! 🎉

Okay, but before installation I got the error building the flutter app:

Your project is configured with Android NDK 26.3.11579264, but the following plugin(s) depend on a different Android NDK version:

path_provider_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973

permission_handler_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973

shared_preferences_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973

webview_flutter_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973 Fix this issue by using the highest Android NDK version (they are backward compatible). Add the following to C:\Users\micha\eclipse-workspace\AudioTours\development\audio_tour_app\android\app\build.gradle.kts:
