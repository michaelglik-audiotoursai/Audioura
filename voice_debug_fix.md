# Voice Command Debug & Enhancement Plan

## Current Issues:
1. Only "Play" command is recognized
2. Volume triple-click changes volume (problematic for bikers)
3. Need better debugging to understand recognition failures

## Enhanced Debugging Added:
- Raw command logging
- Processed command logging  
- Individual condition testing
- Match result logging

## Alternative Activation Methods:
1. **Microphone Button** (already exists) - Best for bikers
2. **Volume Triple-Click** (current) - Works but changes volume
3. **Power Button** (future) - Would need native Android implementation
4. **Shake Gesture** (future) - Would need accelerometer integration

## Immediate Solutions:
1. Use the existing microphone button in tour player
2. Enhanced debugging to identify recognition issues
3. Simplified command matching logic

## Test Commands to Try:
- "Play"
- "Next" 
- "Previous"
- "Pause"
- "Repeat"

## Next Steps:
1. Test with enhanced debugging
2. Check speech recognition language settings
3. Consider adding visual feedback for recognized commands
